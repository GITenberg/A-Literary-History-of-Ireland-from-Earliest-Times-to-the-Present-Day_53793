<h4><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h4>


<p>The present volume has been styled&mdash;in order to make it a
companion book to other of Mr. Unwin's publications&mdash;a
"Literary History of Ireland," but a "Literary History of
Irish Ireland" would be a more correct title, for I have abstained
altogether from any analysis or even mention of the
works of Anglicised Irishmen of the last two centuries. Their
books, as those of Farquhar, of Swift, of Goldsmith, of Burke,
find, and have always found, their true and natural place in
every history of <i>English</i> literature that has been written,
whether by Englishmen themselves or by foreigners.</p>

<p>My object in this volume has been to give a general view of
the literature produced by the Irish-speaking Irish, and to
reproduce by copious examples some of its more salient, or at
least more characteristic features.</p>

<p>In studying the literature itself, both that of the past and
that of the present, one of the things which has most forcibly
struck me is the marked absence of the purely personal note,
the absence of great predominating names, or of great predominating
works; while just as striking is the almost universal
diffusion of a traditional literary taste and a love of
literature in the abstract amongst all classes of the native Irish.
The whole history of Irish literature shows how warmly the
efforts of all who assisted in its production were appreciated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
The greatest English bard of the Elizabethan age was allowed
by his countrymen to perish of poverty in the streets of
London, while the pettiest chief of the meanest clan would
have been proud to lay his hearth and home and a share of his
wealth at the disposal of any Irish "ollamh." The love for
literature of a traditional type, in song, in poem, in saga,
was, I think, more nearly universal in Ireland than in any
country of western Europe, and hence that which appears to
me to be of most value in ancient Irish literature is not that
whose authorship is known, but rather the mass of traditional
matter which seems to have grown up almost spontaneously,
and slowly shaped itself into the literary possession of an entire
nation. An almost universal acquaintance with a traditional
literature was a leading trait amongst the Irish down to the
last century, when every barony and almost every townland
still possessed its poet and reciter, and song, recitation, music,
and oratory were the recognised amusements of nearly the
whole population. That population in consequence, so far as
wit and readiness of language and power of expression went,
had almost all attained a remarkably high level, without however
producing any one of a commanding eminence. In collecting
the floating literature of the present day also, the
unknown traditional poems and the Ossianic ballads and the
stories of unknown authorship are of greater value than the
pieces of bards who are known and named. In both cases,
that of the ancient and that of the modern Irish, all that is of
most value as literature, was the property and in some sense
the product of the people at large, and it exercised upon them
a most striking and potent influence. And this influence may
be traced amongst the Irish-speaking population even at the
present day, who have, I may almost say, one and all, a remarkable
command of language and a large store of traditional
literature learned by heart, which strongly differentiates them
from the Anglicised products of the "National Schools" to
the bulk of whom poetry is an unknown term, and amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
whom there exists little or no trace of traditional Irish feelings,
or indeed seldom of any feelings save those prompted by (when
they read it) a weekly newspaper.</p>

<p>The exact extent of the Irish literature still remaining in
manuscript has never been adequately determined. M. d'Arbois
de Jubainville has noted 133 still existing manuscripts, all
copied before the year 1600, and the whole number which he
has found existing chiefly in public libraries on the Continent
and in the British Isles amounts to 1,009. But many others
have since been discovered, and great numbers must be
scattered throughout the country in private libraries, and
numbers more are perishing or have recently perished of
neglect since the "National Schools" were established.
Jubainville quotes a German as estimating that the literature
produced by the Irish before the seventeenth century, and
still existing, would fill a thousand octavo volumes. It is hard
to say, however, how much of this could be called literature in
a true sense of the word, since law, medicine, and science were
probably included in the calculation. O'Curry, O'Longan,
and O'Beirne Crowe catalogued something more than half the
manuscripts in the Royal Irish Academy, and the catalogue of
contents filled thirteen volumes containing 3,448 pages. To
these an alphabetic index of the pieces contained was made in
three volumes, and an index of the principal names, etc., in
thirteen volumes more. From a rough calculation, based on
an examination of these, I should place the number of different
pieces catalogued by them at about ten thousand, ranging from
single quatrains or even single sentences to long poems and
epic sagas. But in the Academy alone, there are nearly as
many more manuscripts which still remain uncatalogued.</p>

<p>It is probably owing to the extreme difficulty of arriving at
any certain conclusions as to the real extent of Irish literature
that no attempt at a consecutive history of it has ever previously
been made. Despite this difficulty, there is no doubt
that such a work would long ago have been attempted had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
not been for the complete breakdown and destruction of Irish
Ireland which followed the Great Famine, and the unexpected
turn given to Anglo-Irish literature by the efforts of the
Young Ireland School to compete with the English in their
own style, their own language, and their own models.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the many sins of omission and commission in this
volume I must claim the reader's kind indulgence; nobody can
be better aware of its shortcomings than I myself, and the only
excuse that I can plead is that over so much of the ground I have
had to be my own pioneer. I confidently hope, however, that
in the renewed interest now being taken in our native civilisation
and native literature some scholar far more fully
equipped for his task than I, may soon render this volume
superfluous by an ampler, juster, and more artistic treatment
of what is really a subject of great national importance.</p>

<p>National or important, however, it does not appear to be
considered in these islands, where outside of the University of
Oxford&mdash;which has given noble assistance to the cause of Celtic
studies&mdash;sympathisers are both few and far between. Indeed,
I fancy that anybody who has applied himself to the subject of
Celtic literature would have a good deal to tell about the
condescending contempt with which his studies have been
regarded by his fellows. "I shall not easily forget," said Dr.
Petrie, addressing a meeting of the Royal Irish Academy upon
that celebrated example of early Celtic workmanship the Tara
Brooch, "that when in reference to the existence of a similar
remain of ancient Irish art, I had first the honour to address
myself to a meeting of this high institution, I had to encounter
the incredulous astonishment of the illustrious Dr. Brinkley"
[of Trinity College, President of the Academy] "which was
implied in the following remark, 'Surely, sir, you do not mean
to tell us that there exists the slightest evidence to prove that
the Irish had any acquaintance with the arts of civilised life
anterior to the arrival in Ireland of the English?' nor shall I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
forget that in the scepticism which this remark implied nearly
all the members present very obviously participated." Exactly
the same feeling which Dr. Petrie encountered was prevalent
in my own <i>alma mater</i> in the eighties, where one of our most
justly popular lecturers said&mdash;in gross ignorance but perfect
good faith&mdash;that the sooner the Irish recognised that before the
arrival of Cromwell they were utter savages, the better it would
be for everybody concerned! Indeed, it was only the other
day that one of our ablest and best known professors protested
publicly in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> against the enormity of
an Irish bishop signing so moderate, and I am sure so reasonable
a document, as a petition asking to have Irish children
who knew no English, taught through the medium of the
language which they spoke. Last year, too, another most
learned professor of Dublin University went out of his way to
declare that "the mass of material preserved [in the Irish
manuscripts] is out of all proportion to its value as 'literature,'"
and to insist that "in the enormous mass of Irish MSS. preserved,
there is absolutely nothing that in the faintest degree
rivals the splendours of the vernacular literatures of the Middle
Ages," that "their value as literature is but small," and that
"for educational purposes save in this limited sense [of linguistic
study] they are wholly unsuited," winding up with the extraordinary
assertion that "there is no solid ground for supposing
that the tales current at the time of our earliest MSS. were
much more numerous than the tales of which fragments have
come down to us." As to the civilisation of the early Irish
upon which Petrie insisted, there is no longer room for the
very shadow of a doubt; but whether the literature which they
produced is so utterly valueless as this, and so utterly devoid of
all interest as "literature," the reader of this volume must
judge for himself. I should be glad also if he were to institute
a comparison between "the splendours of the vernacular
literatures" of Germany, England, Spain, and even Italy and
France, prior to the year 1000, and that of the Irish, for I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
very much mistaken if in their early development of rhyme,
alone, in their masterly treatment of sound, and in their
absolutely unique and marvellous system of verse-forms, the
Irish will not be found to have created for themselves a place
alone and apart in the history of European literatures.</p>

<p>I hardly know a sharper contrast in the history of human
thought than the true traditional literary instinct which four
years ago prompted fifty thousand poor hard-working Irishmen
in the United States to contribute each a dollar towards the
foundation of a Celtic chair in the Catholic University of
Washington in the land of their adoption, choosing out a fit
man and sending him to study under the great Celticists of
Germany, in the hope that his scholarship might one day
reflect credit upon the far-off country of their birth; while in
that very country, by far the richest college in the British Isles,
one of the wealthiest universities in the world, allows its so-called
"Irish professorship" to be an adjunct of its Divinity
School, founded <i>and paid</i> by a society for&mdash;the conversion of
Irish Roman Catholics through the medium of their own
language!</p>

<p>This is the more to be regretted because had the unique
manuscript treasures now shut up in cases in the underground
room of Trinity College Library, been deposited in any other
seat of learning in Europe, in Paris, Rome, Vienna, or Berlin,
there would long ago have been trained up scholars to read
them, a catalogue of them would have been published, and
funds would have been found to edit them. At present the
Celticists of Europe are placed under the great disadvantage of
having to come over to Dublin University to do the work that
it is not doing for itself.</p>

<p>It is fortunate however that the spread of education within
the last few years (due perhaps partly to the establishment
of the Royal University, partly to the effects of Intermediate
Education, and partly to the numerous literary societies which
working upon more or less national lines have spontaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
sprung up amongst the Irish people themselves) has, by taking
the prestige of literary monopoly out of the hands of Dublin
University, to a great extent undone the damage which had
so long been caused to native scholarship by its attitude.
It was the more necessary to do this, because the very fact
that it had never taken the trouble to publish even a printed
catalogue of its Irish manuscripts&mdash;as the British Museum
authorities have done&mdash;was by many people interpreted, I
believe, as a sort of declaration of their worthlessness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In dealing with Irish proper names I have experienced the
same difficulty as every one else who undertakes to treat of
Irish history. Some native names, especially those with
"mortified" or aspirated letters, look so unpronounceable as to
prove highly disconcerting to an English reader. The system
I have followed is to leave the Irish orthography untouched,
but in cases where the true pronunciation differed appreciably
from the sound which an English reader would give the letters,
I have added a phonetic rendering of the Irish form in
brackets, as "Muighmheadhon [Mwee-va-on], Lughaidh
[Lewy]." There are a few names such as Ossian, Mève,
Donough, Murrough and others, which have been almost
adopted into English, and these forms I have generally retained&mdash;perhaps
wrongly&mdash;but my desire has been to throw no unnecessary
impediments in the way of an English reader; I have
always given the true Irish form at least once. Where the
word "mac" is not part of a proper name, but really means
"son of" as in Finn mac Cúmhail, I have printed it with
a small "m"; and in such names as "Cormac mac Art"
I have usually not inflected the last word, but have written
"Art" not "Airt," so as to avoid as far as possible confusing
the English reader.</p>

<p>I very much regret that I have found it impossible, owing
to the brief space of time between printing and publication,
to submit the following chapters to any of my friends for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
their advice and criticism. I beg, however, to here express
my best thanks to my friend Father Edmund Hogan, S.J.,
for the numerous memoranda which he was kind enough to
give me towards the last chapter of this book, that on the
history of Irish as a spoken language, and also to express my
regret that the valuable critical edition of the Book of Hymns
by Dr. Atkinson and Dr. Bernard, M. Bertrand's "Religion
Gauloise," and Miss Hull's interesting volume on "Cuchullin
Saga," which should be read in connection with my chapters
on the Red Branch cycle, appeared too late for me to make
use of.<br />

<h4>WHO WERE THE CELTS?</h4>


<p>Who were those Celts, of whose race the Irish are to-day
perhaps the most striking representatives, and upon whose past
the ancient literature of Ireland can best throw light?</p>

<p>Like the Greeks, like the Romans, like the English, this
great people, which once ruled over a fourth of Europe, sprang
from a small beginning and from narrow confines. The
earliest home of the race from which they spread their conquering
arms may be said, roughly speaking, to have lain along
both banks of the upper Danube, and in that portion of
Europe comprised to-day in the kingdoms of Bavaria and
Würtemberg and the Grand Duchy of Baden, with the
country drained by the river Maine to the east of the Rhine
basin. In other words, the Celtic race and the Celtic language
sprang from the heart of what is to-day modern Germany, and
issuing thence established for over two centuries a vast empire
held together by the ties of political unity and a common
language over all North-west and Central Europe.</p>

<p>The vast extent of the territory conquered and colonised by
the Celts, and the unity of their speech, may be conjectured
from an examination of the place-names of Celtic origin which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
either still exist or figure as having existed in European
history.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Celts seem to have been first known to Greek&mdash;that is,
to European history&mdash;under the semi-mythological name of
the Hyperboreans,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> an appellation which remained in force
from the sixth to the fourth century before Christ. The
name Celt or Kelt<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> first makes its appearance towards the year
500 B.C., in the geography of Hecatæus of Miletum, and is
thereafter used successively by Herodotus, Xenophon, Plato,
and Aristotle, and from that time forward it seems to have
been employed by the Greek scholars and historians as a
generic term whereby to designate the Celts of the Continent.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the word Galatian came also into use,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
was used as a synonym for Celt. In the first century B.C.,
however, the discovery was made that the Germans and the
Celts, who had been hitherto confounded in the popular estimation,
were really two different peoples, a fact which Julius
Cæsar was almost the first to point out. Diodorus Siculus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
accordingly, struck by this discovery, translates Cæsar's <i>Gallus</i>
or Gaul by the word Celt, and his <i>Germanus</i> or German by
the word Galatian, while the other Greek historian, Dion Cassius,
does the exact opposite, calling the Celts "Galatians," and the
Germans "Celts"! The examples thus set, however, were the
result of ignorance and were never followed. Plutarch treats
the two words as identical, as do Strabo, Pausanias and all
other Greek writers.</p>

<p>The word Celt itself is probably of very ancient origin, and
was, no doubt, in use 800 or 1,000 years before Christ.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It
cannot, however, be proved that it is a generic Celtic name for
the Celtic race, and none of the present Celtic-speaking races
have preserved it in their dialects. Jubainville derives it, very
doubtfully I should think, from a Celtic root found in the old
Irish verb "ar-CHELL-aim" ("I plunder") and the old substantive
to-CHELL ("victory"); while he derives Galatian from a Celtic
substantive now represented by the Irish <i>gal</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> ("bravery").
This latter word "Galatian" is one which the German peoples
never adopted, and it appears to have only come into use subsequently
to their revolt against their Celtic masters. After the
break-up of the Celtic Empire it was employed to designate the
eastern portion of the race, while the inhabitants of Gaul were
called Celtæ and those of Spain Celtici or Celtiberi, but the
Greeks called all indifferently by the common name of Galatians.</p>

<p>The Romans termed the Celts Galli, or Gauls, but they
used the geographical term Gallia, or Gaul, in a restricted
sense, first for the country inhabited by the Celts in North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Italy upon their own side of the Alps, and after that for the
Celtic territory conquered by Rome upon the other side of the
Alps.</p>

<p>The Germans appear to have called the Celts Wolah, a
name derived from the Celtic tribe the Volcæ, who were so
long their neighbours, out of which appellation came the
Anglo-Saxon Wealh and the modern English "Welsh."</p>

<p>There is one curious characteristic distinguishing, from its
very earliest appearance, the Celtic language from its Indo-European
sisters: this is the loss of the letter <i>p</i> both at the
beginning of a word and when it is placed between two
vowels.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This dropping of the letter <i>p</i> had already given to
the Celtic language a special character of its own, at the time
when breaking forth from their earliest home the Celts crossed
the Rhine and proceeded, perhaps a thousand years before
Christ, to establish themselves in the British Isles. The Celts
who first colonised Ireland said, for instance, <i>atir</i> for <i>pater</i>,
but they had not yet experienced, nor did they ever experience,
that curious linguistic change which at a later time is assumed
to have come over the Celts of the Continent and caused
them to not only recover their faculty of pronouncing <i>p</i>,
but to actually <i>change into a p</i> the Indo-European guttural
<i>q</i>. Their descendants, the modern Irish, to this very day
retain the primitive word-forms which had their origin a
thousand years before Christ. So much so is this the case
that the Welsh antiquary Lhuyd, writing in the last century,
asserted, and with truth, that there were "scarce any words
in the Irish besides what are borrowed from the Latin or
some other language that begin with <i>p</i>, insomuch that in
an ancient alphabetical vocabulary I have by me, that letter is
omitted."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Even with the introduction of Christianity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the knowledge of Latin the ancient Irish persisted in their
repugnance to this letter, and made of the Latin <i>Pasch-a</i>
(Easter) the word <i>Cásg</i>, and of the Latin <i>purpur-a</i> the Irish
<i>curcur</i>.</p>

<p>But meantime the Continental Celts had either&mdash;as Jubainville
seems to think&mdash;recovered their faculty for pronouncing
<i>p</i>, or else&mdash;as Rhys believes&mdash;been overrun by other semi-Celts
who, owing to some strong non-Aryan intermixture, found <i>q</i>
repugnant to them, and changed it into <i>p</i>. This appears to have
taken place prior to the year 500 B.C., for it was at about this
time that they, having established themselves round the Seine
and Loire and north of the Garonne, overran Spain, carrying
everywhere with them this comparatively newly adopted <i>p</i>,
as we can see by their tribal and place-names. They appeared
in Italy sometime about 400 B.C.,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> founded their colony in
Galatia about 279 B.C., and afterwards sent another swarm into
Great Britain, and to all these places they bore with them this
obtrusive letter in place of the primitive <i>q</i>, the Irish alone
resisting it, for the Irish represented a first off-shoot from the
cradle of the race, an off-shoot which had left it at a time
when <i>q</i> represented <i>p</i>, and not <i>p q</i>. Hence it is that Welsh is
so full of the <i>p</i> sound which the primitive Irish would never
adopt, as a glance at some of the commonest words in both
languages will show.</p>

<p>So that even the Irish St. Ciaran becomes Piaran in Wales.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The Celts invaded Italy about the year 400 B.C., and
stormed Rome a few years later. They were at this time at
the height of their power. From about the year 500 to 300
B.C. they appear to have possessed a very high degree of
political unity, to have been led by a single king,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and to have
followed with signal success a wise and consistent external
policy. The most important events in their history during
this period were the three successful wars which they waged&mdash;first
against the Carthaginians, out of whose hands they wrested
the peninsula of Spain; secondly in Italy against the Etruscans,
which ended in their making themselves masters of the north
of that country; and thirdly against the Illyrians along the
Danube. All of these wars were followed by large accessions
of territory. One of the most striking features of their
external policy during this period was their close alliance with
the Greeks, whose commercial rivalry with the Ph&#339;nicians
naturally brought them into relations with the Celtic enemies
of Carthaginian power in Spain, relations from which they
reaped much advantage, since the necessity of making head
against the Celtic invaders of Spain must have seriously
crippled the Carthaginian power, at the very time when, as
ally of the Persians, she attacked the Greeks in Sicily, and lost
the battle of Himera on the same day that the Persians lost
that of Salamis. Greek writers of the fourth century speak of
the Celts as practising justice, of having nearly the same
manners and customs as the Greeks, and they notice their
hospitality to Grecian strangers.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Their war with the Etruscans
in North Italy completed the ruin of an hereditary enemy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the Greeks,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and their war with the Illyrians no doubt largely
strengthened the hands of Philip, the father of Alexander the
Great, and enabled him to throw off the tribute which the
Illyrians had imposed upon Macedonia. Nor did Alexander
himself embark upon his expedition into Asia without having
first assured himself of the friendship of the Celts. He
received their ambassadors with cordiality, called them his
friends, and received from them a promise of alliance. "If we
fulfil not our engagement," said they, "may the sky falling upon
us crush us, may the earth opening swallow us up, may the sea
overflowing its borders drown us," and we may well believe
that these were the very words used by the Celtic chieftains
when we find in an Irish saga committed to writing about the
seventh century<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the Ulster heroes swearing to their king when
he wished to leave his wing of the battle to repel the attacks
of a rival, and saying, "heaven is over us and earth is under
us and sea is round about us, and unless the firmament fall
with its star-showers upon the face of the earth, or unless
the earth be destroyed by earthquake, or unless the ridgy,
blue-bordered sea come over the expanse (?) of life, we shall
not give one inch of ground."</p>

<p>While the ambassadors were drinking the young king asked
them what was the thing they most feared, thinking, says the
historian, that they would say himself, but their answer was
quite different. "We fear no one," they said; "there is
only one thing that we fear, which is, that the heavens may
fall upon us; but the friendship of such a man as you we
value more than everything," whereat the king, no doubt
considerably astonished, remarked in a low voice to his
courtiers what a vainglorious people these Celts were.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>All through the life of Alexander the Celts and Macedonians
continued on good terms, and amongst the many envoys
who came to Babylon to salute the youthful conqueror of
Persia, appeared their representatives also. Some forty years
later, however, this good understanding came to an end, and
the Celts overthrew and slew in battle the Macedonian ruler
Ptolemy Keraunos about 280 B.C.</p>

<p>With the Romans, as with the Greeks, the relations of the
Celts were, during the fifth and fourth century B.C., upon the
whole friendly, and their hostility to the Etruscans must have
tended naturally to render them and the Romans mutual allies.
The battle of Allia, fought on the 18th of July, 390 B.C., and
the storming of Rome three days later, were a punishment
inflicted on the Romans by the Celts in their exasperation
at seeing the Roman ambassadors, contrary to the right of
nations, assisting their enemies the Etruscans under the walls
of Clusium, but these events appear to have been followed by
a long peace.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>It is only in the third century B.C. that the hitherto
victorious and widely-colonising Celts appear to have laid
aside their internal political unity and to have lost their
hitherto victorious tactics. The Germans, over whom they
had for centuries domineered and whom they had deprived of
their independence, rise against them about 300 B.C., and
drive out their former conquerors from between the Rhine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the Black Sea, from between the Elbe and the Maine. The
Celts fall out with the Romans and are beaten at Sentinum in
295 B.C.; they ally themselves with their former enemies the
Etruscans, and are again beaten in 283 B.C. and lose territory.
They cease their alliance with the Greeks, and are guilty of
the shameful folly of pillaging the temple of Delphi, an act
of brigandage from which no good results could come, and
from which no acquisition of territory resulted. They established
a colony in Asia Minor in 278 B.C., successfully indeed,
but absolutely cut off from the rest of the Celtic Empire, and
such as in any federation of the Celtic tribes could only be a
source of weakness. Again, about the same time, we see
Celts driving out and supplanting Celts in the districts
between the Rhine, the Seine, and the Marne. In 262 B.C.
we find a body of three or four thousand Celts assisting their
former foes the Carthaginians at the siege of Agrigentum,
where they perish. Many of the Celts now took foreign
service. It was at their instigation that the war of mercenaries
broke out, which at one time brought Carthage to
the very verge of destruction.</p>

<p>Only two centuries and a half, as Jubainville remarks, had
elapsed since the Celts had conquered Spain from the Ph&#339;nicians,
and only a hundred and thirty years since they had
taken Rome, but their victorious political unity had already
begun to break up and crumble, and now Rome and Carthage
commenced that deadly duel in which the victor was destined
to impose his sway upon the ruins of the Celtic Empire as
well as on that of Alexander&mdash;impose it, in fact, upon all the
world then known to the Greeks, except only the extreme east.</p>

<p>One of the circumstances which must have helped most
materially to break up the Celtic Empire was the successful
revolt of the Germans against their former masters. The
relation of the German to the Celtic tribes is very obscure
and puzzling. The ancient Greek historians of the sixth,
fifth, and fourth centuries B.C., who tell us so much about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Celts, know absolutely nothing of the Germans. As early as
the year 500 B.C. Hecatæus of Miletum is able to name three
peoples and two cities of India. But of the Germans, who
were so much nearer to Marseilles than the nearest point of
India is to the most eastern Greek colony, he says not a word.
Ephorus, in the fourth century, knows of only one people to
the extreme west, and they are the Celts, and their immediate
neighbours are the Scythians. He knows of no intermediate
state or nation. Where, then, were the Germans?</p>

<p>The explanation lies, according to Jubainville, in this, that
even before this period the German had been conquered by
the Celt and become subordinated to him. The Greek
historians knew of no independent state bordering upon the
Scythians except the Celtic Empire alone, because none such
existed. In the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., and perhaps as
early as the seventh and sixth, the Germans had been subdued
and had lost their independence. How and when this took
place we can only conjecture, but we have philological reasons
for believing that the two races had come into mutual contact
at a very early date, probably as early as the eleventh century
B.C. The early German name for the Rhine, for instance,
<i>R&#299;no-s</i>, comes directly from the primitive Indo-European form
<i>Reino-s</i> and not from the Celtic <i>R&#275;no-s</i>, which shows that the
Germans had reached that river at a time when the Celts who
lived along it still called it Reinos, not R&#275;nos. The Celts
afterwards changed the primitive <i>ei</i> into <i>&#275;</i>, and from their
carrying the form <i>réin</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> with them into Ireland, they had
probably done this as early as the ninth or tenth century B.C.,
for, as we have shown, the Celts who inhabited Ireland have
preserved the very oldest forms of the Celtic speech.</p>

<p>On the other hand the Celts always called that Germanic
tribe who accompanied the Cimbri by the name of Teutoni,
thus showing that they first came in contact with them at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
date anterior to the phonetic law which introduced the so-called
explosive consonants into German, and which caused the
root Teutono (preserved intact by the Celts) to be turned into
Theudono. From this it follows that the German and Celtic
peoples were in touch with one another at a very remote period.</p>

<p>The long subordination of the German to the Celt has left
its marks deeply behind it, for his "language had remained uncultivated
during ages of slavery, had been reduced to the
condition of a patois, and had forced the explosive consonants to
submit to modifications of sound, the analogues of which appear
in the Latin and Celtic languages during their decadence many
centuries after those modifications of sound had deformed the
language of the Germans."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In fine the Germanic has created for itself a place apart, amongst
the other Indo-European languages, though the excessive poverty
of its conjugation, which only knows three tenses&mdash;the present tense
and two past tenses&mdash;and which has lost in particular the imperfect
or secondary present, the future, and the sigmatic aorist, and which
has not had strength to regain those losses by the aid of new composite
tenses, with the exception of its dental preterite. The Celtic
has preserved the three tenses which the Germanic has lost."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Celtic language is in a manner allied to that of Italy,
as is shown by its <i>grammar</i>, and out of all the circle of Indo-European
languages the Latin comes nearest to it, and it and
the Latin possess certain grammatical characteristics in common
which are absent from the others.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> To account for these we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
assume what may be called an Italo-Celtic period, prior, probably,
to the establishment of the Italian races in Italy, perhaps
some twelve hundred years before Christ.</p>

<p>On the other hand such mutual influence as Celtic and
German have exercised upon each other is restricted merely to
the <i>vocabularies</i> of the languages, for when these races came in
contact with each other the two tongues had been already
completely formed, and the grammar of the one could no longer
be affected by that of the other.</p>

<p>That there existed a kind of Celto-Germanic civilisation is
easily proved by the number of words common to each language
which are not found in the other Indo-European tongues,
or which if they occur in them, are found bearing a different
meaning. The two peoples, the dominant Celts and the
subject Germans, obeyed the same chiefs and fought in the
same armies, and naturally a certain number of words became
common to both. It is noticeable, however, that none of the
terms relating to either gods or priests or religious ceremonies
bear in either language the slightest resemblance to one another.
It was probably this difference of religion which preserved the
conquered people from being assimilated, and which was ultimately
the cause of the successful uprising of the servile tribes.</p>

<p>The words which are common to the Germanic and the
Celtic languages belong either to the art of government,
political institutions, and law, or else to the art of war. These
d'Arbois de Jubainville divides into two classes&mdash;those which can
be phonetically proved to be of Celtic origin, and those which,
though almost certainly of Celtic origin, yet cannot be proved
to be so to actual demonstration. Such important German
words<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> as <i>Reich</i> and <i>Amt</i> are beyond all doubt Celtic loan-words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
as are probably such familiar vocables as <i>Bann, frei,
Eid, Geisel, leihen, Erbe, Werth,</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> all terms relating to law and
government, imposed on or borrowed by the conquered Germans.
From the Celts come also all such words concerning war and
fighting as are common to both nations, such as <i>Held, Heer,
Sieg, Beute</i>. From the Celts too come names of domiciles, as
<i>Burg, Dorf, Zaun,</i> also of localities as <i>Land, Flur, Furt,</i> and the
English <i>wood</i>, and of domestic aids as <i>Pferd, Beil,</i> and the Anglo-Saxon
<i>Vîr</i> (a torque). They too seem to have been the first
in Northern Europe to have practised the art of medicine, for
from the Celtic comes the Gothic <i>l&#275;keis</i>&mdash;English <i>leech</i>.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Certain other domestic words, such as <i>Eisen, Loth,</i> and <i>Leder</i>,
both races have in common.</p>

<p>Despite the long subjection of the Germans they never lost
their language, nor were they assimilated by the conquering
race, a fate from which they were probably preserved, as we have
said, by the complete difference of their sacred customs. There is
hardly one name in all the Teutonic theogony which even faintly
resembles a Celtic one.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Their funeral rites were different,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the Germans burning, but the Celts burying their dead. Their
systems of priesthood were absolutely different, that of the
Celts being always an institution distinct from the kingship,
while that of the Germans was for centuries vested in the head
of the tribe or family. The priests of the Germans, even after
the functions of priesthood had been severed from those of
kingship, still exercised criminal jurisdiction, and even in the
army a soldier could not be punished without their sanction.
On the other hand the milder druids of the Celts appear
to have never taken part in the judgment of delinquents
against the State. Cæsar makes no mention of their ever
acting as judges in criminal cases. The culprit guilty or
treason was not put to death by them but by the citizens&mdash;<i>ab
civitate</i>.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It was about the year 300 B.C. that the German tribes, so
long incorporated with the Celts, at last rose against their
masters and broke their yoke from off their necks. They
succeeded in dislodging the Celts from the country which lies
between the Rhine and the North Sea, between the Elbe and
the basin of the Maine. It was in consequence of this blow
that the Celtic Belgæ were obliged to withdraw from the
right bank of the Rhine to the left, and to occupy the country
between it, the Seine, and the Marne, whilst other tribes
settled themselves along the Rhine, and others again marched
upon Asia Minor and founded their famous colony of Galatia
in the extreme east of Europe, to whom, over three centuries
later, St. Paul addressed his epistle, and whose descendants were
found by St. Jerome in the fourth century still speaking
Celtic.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>It is no longer necessary to follow the fortunes of the Continental
Celts, to trace the history of their Galatian colony, to
tell how they lost Spain, to recount the exploits of Marius and
Sylla, the wars of Cæsar, the heroic struggle of Vercingetorix,
the division of Gaul by Octavius, the oppression of the Romans,
and finally the inroads of the barbaric hordes of Visigoths,
Burgundians, and Francs. It is sufficient to say that already
in the third century of our era Gaul had lost every trace of its
ancient Celtic organisation, and in its laws, habits, and civil
administration had become purely Roman. The upper classes
had, like the Irish upper classes of this and of the last century,
thrown aside every vestige of Gaulish nationality, and piqued
themselves upon the perfection with which they had Romanised
themselves, as the Irish upper classes do upon the thoroughness
with which they have become Anglicised. They threw aside
their Gaulish names to adopt others more consonant to Latin ears,
as the Irish are doing at this moment. Above all they prided
themselves upon speaking only the language of their conquerors,
and like so many of the Irish of to-day they derided their ancient
language as <i>lingua rustica</i>. It, however, banished from the
mouths of the nobles and officials, lived on in the villages and
rural parts of Gaul, as it has to this day done in Ireland, until
the sixth century, when it finally gave ground and retired into
the mountains and wastes of Armorica, where it coalesced
with the Welsh which the large colony of British brought in
with them when flying from the Saxon, and where it, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Cymraeg form of it, is still spoken by a couple of million

Celtic was once spoken from Ireland to the Black Sea, although the
population who can now speak Celtic dialects is not more than three or four
millions. As for Celtic archæological remains "on les trouve tant dans

<p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Although Celtic has so long disappeared out of France with the
exception of Armorica, it has left its traces deeply behind it upon the
French language. This is also true even of linguistic sounds. "Tous
les sons simples du français se retrouvent dans le breton, et tous ceux
du breton à l'exception d'un seul (le <i>ch</i> ou le <i>&#967;</i>) sont aussi dans notre
langue: l'<i>u</i> et l'<i>e</i> très-ouvert, l'<i>e</i> muet si rare partout ailleurs, le <i>j</i> pur
inconnu à toute l'Europe, les deux sons mouillés du <i>n</i> et du <i>l</i> (comme
dans les mots bataille et dignité) sont communs à la langue française
et aux idiomes celtiques," says Demogeot. Even in French customary
law there are "distinct and numerous traces" of old Gaulish habits and
legislation, as Laferrière has pointed out in his history of the civil law
of Rome and France. Nor is this to be in the least wondered at, when
we remember that nineteen-twentieths of the modern French blood is
computed to be that of the aboriginal races&mdash;Aquitanians, Celts, and Belgæ;
whilst out of the remaining twentieth "the descendants of the Teutonic invaders&mdash;Franks,
Burgundians, Goths, and Normans doubtless contributed
a more numerous element to the population than the Romans, who, though
fewer in number than any of the others, imposed their language on the
whole country" (<i>see</i> Taylor's "Origin of the Aryans," p. 204). The bulk
of the French nation is probably pre-Celtic. The modern Frenchman does
not at all resemble the Gallic type as described by the Greek and Roman
writers.</p></div>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h5>

<h4>EARLIEST ALLUSIONS TO IRELAND FROM FOREIGN SOURCES</h4>


<p>Of all the tribes of the Celts, and indeed of all their neighbours
in the west of Europe, the children of Milesius have been
at once blessed and cursed beyond their fellows, for on the
shores of their island alone did the Roman eagle check its
victorious flight, and they alone of the nations of western
Europe were neither moulded nor crushed into his own shape
by the conqueror of Gaul and Britain.</p>

<p>Undisturbed by the Romans, unconquered though shattered
by the Norsemen, unsubdued though sore-stricken by the
Normans, and still struggling with the Saxons, the Irish Gael
alone has preserved a record of his own past, and preserved it
in a literature of his own, for a length of time and with a continuity
which outside of Greece has no parallel in Europe.</p>

<p>His own account of himself is that his ancestors, the Milesians,
or children of Miledh,<a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> came to Ireland from Spain about the
year 1000 B.C.,<a name="FNanchor_2_30" id="FNanchor_2_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_30" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and dispossessed the Tuatha De Danann who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
had come from the north of Europe, as these had previously
dispossessed their kinsmen the Firbolg, who had arrived from
Greece.</p>

<p>Such a suggestion, however, despite the continuity and
volume of Irish tradition which has always supported it, appears
open to more than one rationalistic objection, the chiefest
being that the voyage from Spain to Ireland would be one of
some six hundred miles, hardly to be attempted by the early
Irish barks composed of wickerwork covered with hides, fragile
crafts which could hardly hope to live through the rough waters
of the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic on a voyage from Spain,
or through the Mediterranean and the Atlantic on a voyage
from Greece.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we assume that our ancestors passed
over from Gaul into Britain and thence into Ireland, we
shall find it fit in with many other facts. To begin with, the
voyage from Gaul to Britain is one of only some two and
twenty miles, and from Britain to Ireland, at its narrowest
point, is hardly twelve. The splendid physique, too, of the
Irish,<a name="FNanchor_3_31" id="FNanchor_3_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_31" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which is now alas! sadly degenerated through depression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
poverty, famine, and the rooting out of the best blood, but which
has struck during the course of history such numerous foreign
observers, seems certainly to connect the Irish by a family
likeness with the Gauls, as these have been described to us by
the Romans, and not with the Greeks or the swarthy, sun-burnt
Iberians. Tacitus also, writing less than a century after
Christ, tells us that the Irish in disposition, temper, and habits,
differ but little from the Britons, and we find in Britain, North
Gaul, and Germany, tribes of the same nomenclature as several
of those Irish tribes whose names are recorded by Ptolemy
about the year 150.<a name="FNanchor_4_32" id="FNanchor_4_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_32" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>On the one hand, then, we have the ancient universal Irish
traditions, backed up by all the authority of the bards, the
annalists and the shanachies, that the Milesians&mdash;who are the
ancestors of most of the present Irish&mdash;came to Ireland direct
from Spain; and, on the other hand, we have these rationalistic
grounds for believing that Ireland was more probably peopled
from Gaul and Britain. The question cannot here be carried
further, except to remark that in an age ignorant of geography
the term Spain may have been used very loosely, and may rather
have implied some land oversea, rather than any particular
land.<a name="FNanchor_5_33" id="FNanchor_5_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_33" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>If Ireland were not&mdash;thanks to her native annalists, her
autochtonous traditions and her bardic histories&mdash;to a great
extent independent of classical and foreign authors, she would
have fared badly indeed, so far as history goes, lying as she
does in so remote a corner of the world, and having been
untrodden by the foot of recording Greek or masterful
Roman. There are, however, some few allusions to the
island to be found, of which, perhaps, the earliest is the quotation
in Avienus, who writing about the year 380 mentions the
account of the voyage of Himilco, a Ph&#339;nician,<a name="FNanchor_6_34" id="FNanchor_6_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_34" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to Ireland
about the year 510 B.C., who said in his account that Erin was
called "Sacra"<a name="FNanchor_7_35" id="FNanchor_7_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_35" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> by the ancients, that its people navigated the
vast sea in hide-covered barks, and that its land was populous
and fertile. In the Argonautics of the pseudo-Orpheus, which
may have been written about 500 B.C., the Iernian<a name="FNanchor_8_36" id="FNanchor_8_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_36" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
apparently the Irish&mdash;Isle is mentioned. Aristotle knew
about it too. Ierne, he says, is a very large island beyond the
Celts. Strabo, writing soon after the birth of Christ, describes
its position and shape, also calling it Ierne, but according to
his account&mdash;which he acknowledges, however, that he does
not make on good authority&mdash;it is barely habitable and its
people are the most utter savages and cannibals.<a name="FNanchor_9_37" id="FNanchor_9_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_37" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Hibernia,
says Julius Cæsar, is esteemed half the size of Britain and is as
distant from it as Gaul is. Diodorus, some fifty years before
Christ, calls it Iris, and says it was occupied by Britons.<a name="FNanchor_10_38" id="FNanchor_10_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_38" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Pomponius Mela, in the first century of our era, calls Ireland
Iverna, and says that "so great was the luxuriance of grass
there as to cause the cattle to burst"! Tacitus a little later,
about the year 82, telling us how Agricola crossed the Clyde
and posted troops in that part of the country which looked
toward Ireland, says that Hibernia "in soil and climate, in the
disposition, temper, and habits of its people, differed but little
from Britain, and that its approaches and harbours were better
known through traffic and merchants."<a name="FNanchor_11_39" id="FNanchor_11_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_39" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Ptolemy, writing about the year 150, unconsciously bears
out to some extent what Tacitus had said of Ireland's
harbours being better known than those of Britain, for he has
left behind him a more accurate account of Ireland than of
Britain, giving in all over fifty Irish names, about nine of
which have been identified, and mentioning the names of two
coast towns, seven inland towns, and seventeen tribes, some of
which, as we have said, nearly resemble the names of tribes in
Britain and North Gaul. Solinus, about A.D. 238, is the first
to tell us that Hibernia has no snakes&mdash;observe this curious
pre-Patrician evidence which robs our national saint of one of
his laurels&mdash;saying, like Pomponius Mela, that it has luxurious
pastures, and adding the curious intelligence that, "warlike
beyond the rest of her sex, the Hibernian mother places the
first morsel of food in her child's mouth with the point of the
sword." Eumenius mentions the Hibernians about the year
306 in his panegyric on Constantine, saying that until now
the Britons had been accustomed to fight only Pictish and
Hibernian enemies. In 378 Ammianus Marcellinus mentions
the Irish under the name of Scots, saying that the Scotti and
Attacotti<a name="FNanchor_12_40" id="FNanchor_12_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_40" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> commit dreadful depredations in Britain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Claudian a few years later speaks rather hyperbolically of the
Irish invasion of Britain; "the Scot (<i>i.e.</i>, the Irishman)," he
says, "moved all Ierne against us, and the Ocean foamed under
his hostile oars&mdash;a Roman legion curbs the fierce Scot, through
Stilicho's care I feared not the darts of the Scots&mdash;Icy Erin
wails over the heaps of her Scots."<a name="FNanchor_13_41" id="FNanchor_13_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_41" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The Irish expeditions
against both Gaul and Britain became more frequent towards
the end of the fourth century, and at last the unfortunate
Britons, driven to despair, and having in vain appealed to the
now disorganised Romans to aid them, sooner than stand the
fury of the Irish and Picts threw themselves into the arms of
the Saxons.<a name="FNanchor_14_42" id="FNanchor_14_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_42" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It is towards the middle or close of the fourth century that
we come into much closer historical contact with the Irish,
and indeed we know with some certainty a good deal about
their internal history, manners, laws, language, and institutions
from that time to the present. Of course if we can trust
Irish sources we know a great deal about them for even seven
or eight hundred years before this. The early Irish annalist,
Tighearnach,<a name="FNanchor_15_43" id="FNanchor_15_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_43" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> who died in 1088, and who had of course the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
records of the earliest Irish writers&mdash;so far as they had escaped
extinction by the Danes&mdash;before his eyes when he wrote, and
who quotes frequently and judiciously from Josephus, St. Jerome,
Bede, and other authors, was of opinion, after weighing evidence
and comparing Irish with foreign writers, that the <i>monumenta
Scotorum</i>, or records of the Irish prior to Cimbaeth (<i>i.e.</i>, about
300 B.C.) were uncertain. This means that from that time
forwards he at least considered that the substance of Irish
history as handed down to us might, to say the least of it, be
more or less relied upon. Cimbaeth was the founder of
Emania, the capital of Ulster, the home of the Red Branch
knights, which flourished for 600 years and which figures so
conspicuously in the saga-cycle of Cuchulain.</p>

<p>What then&mdash;for we pass over for the present the colonies of
Partholan, the Tuatha De Danann, and the Nemedians,
leaving them to be dealt with among the myths&mdash;have our
native bards and annalists to say of these six or seven centuries?
As several of the best and greatest of Irish sagas deal with
events within this period, we can&mdash;if bardic accounts, probably
first committed to writing about the sixth or seventh century
may at all be trusted&mdash;to some extent recall its leading features,
or reconstruct them.</p>

the time of Charlemagne, gives two different accounts of the landing of
the Irish, one evidently representing the British tradition, and the other
that of the Irish themselves, of which he says <i>sic mihi peritissimi Scotorum
nunciaverunt</i>. Both these accounts make the Irish come from Spain, the

nevertheless write thus of the natives in the twelfth century. "In Ireland
man retains all his majesty. Nature alone has moulded the Irish, and as
if to show what she can do has given them countenances of exquisite
colour, and bodies of great beauty, symmetry, and strength." This testimony
agrees with what Cæsar says of the Celts of Gaul, whose large persons
he compares with the short stature of the Romans, and admires their
<i>mirifica corpora</i>. Strabo says of a Celtic tribe, the Coritavi, "to show how
tall they are, I myself saw some of their young men at Rome, and they
were taller by six inches than any one else in the city." The Belgic Gauls
are uniformly described as tall, large-limbed, and fair, and Silius Italicus
speaks of the huge limbs and golden locks of the Boii who gave their name
to Bavaria (Boio-varia) and to Bohemia (Boio-haims). They were probably
the ruling race in Gaul, but the type is now very rarely seen there, the
aristocratic Celts having been largely wiped out by war, as in Ireland, and
having when shorn of their power become amalgamated with the Ligurians
and other pre-Celtic peoples.</p></div>

objections against the Irish tradition, is thus fairly answered by Keating,
writing in Irish, about half a century after Buchanan's death: "The first
of these reasons," says Keating (to prove that the Irish came from Gaul),
"he deduces from the fact that Gaul was formerly so populous that the
part of it called Gallia Lugdunensis would of itself furnish 300,000 fighting
men, and that it was therefore likely that it had sent forth some such
hordes to occupy Ireland, as were the tribes of the Gauls. My answer to
that is that the author himself knew nothing of the specific time at which
the Sons of Miledh arrived in Ireland, and that he was consequently
perfectly ignorant as to whether France was populous or waste at that
epoch. And even though the country were as populous as he states, when
the Sons of Miledh came to Ireland, it does not follow that we must
necessarily understand that <i>it</i> was the country whence they emigrated; for
why should it be supposed to be more populous at that time than Spain,
the country they really did come from?"</p></div>

Britain; but when we consider the antiquarian evidence for ancient Irish
civilisation, and that in artistic treatment, and fineness of manufacture
Irish bronzes are fully equal to those of Great Britain, and her gold objects
infinitely more numerous and every way superior, there seems no reason

continuis." These Attacotti appear to have been an Irish tribe. There is a
great deal of controversy as to who they were. St. Jerome twice mentions
them in connection with the Scots (<i>i.e.</i>, the Irish): <i>Scotorum et Atticotorum
ritu</i>, they have their wives and children in common, as Plato recommends
in his Republic! (Migne's edition, Book I., p. 735.) He says that he himself
saw some of them when he was young, "<i>Ipse adolescens in Gallia viderim
Attacottos, Scotorum</i> (one would expect <i>Attacotorum</i>) <i>natio uxores proprias

so well known in Irish history, a name which O'Curry translates by
"rent-paying tribes," probably of non-Milesian origin. These rose in the
first century against their Milesian masters and massacred them. If as
Thierry thinks the east and centre of Gaul were Gaelic speaking, they too
may have had their Aitheach-Tuatha, which may have been a general name
for certain non-Celtic tribes reduced by the Celts. According to the
Itinerarium of Ricardus Corinensis quoted by Diefenbach, Book III., there
were Attacotti along the banks of the Clyde: "<i>Clottæ ripas accolebant Attacotti,

<h4>EARLY HISTORY DRAWN FROM NATIVE SOURCES</h4>


<p>The allusions to Ireland and the Irish from the third century
before to the fourth century after Christ, are, as we have seen,
both few and scanty, and throw little or no light upon the
internal affairs or history of the island; for these we must go
to native sources.</p>

<p>At the period when Emania was founded, that is, at the
period when according to the learned native annalist Tighearnach,
the records of the early Irish cease to be "uncertain,"
the throne of Ireland was occupied by a High-king called
Ugony<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_44" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the Great, and a certain body of saga, much of which
is now lost, collected itself around his personality, and attached
itself to his two sons, Cobhthach Caol-mBreagh and Leary<a name="FNanchor_2_45" id="FNanchor_2_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_45" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Lorc, and around Leary Lorc's grandson, Lowry<a name="FNanchor_3_46" id="FNanchor_3_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_46" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the mariner.
It was this Ugony who attempted to substitute a new territorial
division of Ireland in place of the five provinces into
which it had been divided by the early Milesians. He exacted
an oath by all the elements&mdash;the usual Pagan oath&mdash;from the
men of Ireland that they would never oppose his children or
his race, and then he divided the island into twenty-five parts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
giving one to each of his children. He succeeded in this
manner in destroying the ancient division of Ireland into
provinces and in perpetuating his own, for several generations,
when Eochaidh Féidhleach<a name="FNanchor_4_47" id="FNanchor_4_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_47" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> once more reverted to the ancient
system of the five provinces&mdash;Ulster, Connacht, Leinster, and
the two Munsters. This Eochaidh Féidhleach came to the
throne about 140 years before Christ, according to the "Four
Masters,"<a name="FNanchor_5_48" id="FNanchor_5_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_48" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and it was his daughter who is the celebrated heroine
Mève,<a name="FNanchor_6_49" id="FNanchor_6_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_49" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> queen of Connacht, who reigned at Rathcroghan in
Connacht, and who undertook the great Táin Bo or Cattle
Raid into Ulster, that has been celebrated for nigh on 2,000
years in poem and annal among the children of the Gael; and
her name introduces us to Conor<a name="FNanchor_7_50" id="FNanchor_7_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_50" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> mac Nessa, king of Ulster,
to the palace of Emania, to the Red Branch knights, to the
tragedy of Déirdre and all the vivid associations of the Cuchulain
cycle.</p>

<p>It was thirty-three years before Christ, according to the
"Four Masters," that Conairé the Great, High-king of all
Ireland, was slain, and he is the central figure of the famous
and very ancient saga of the Bruidhean Da Derga.<a name="FNanchor_8_51" id="FNanchor_8_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_51" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>And now we come to the birth of Christ, which is thus
recorded by the "Four Masters": "The first year of the age of
Christ and the eighth of the reign of Crimhthan Niadhnair."<a name="FNanchor_9_52" id="FNanchor_9_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_52" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Crimhthan was no doubt one of the marauding Scots who
plundered Britain, for it is recorded of him that "it was this
Crimhthan who went on the famous expedition beyond the sea
from which he brought home several extraordinary and costly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
treasures, among which were a gilt chariot and a golden chess-board,
inlaid with three hundred transparent gems, a tunic of
various colours and embroidered with gold, a shield embossed
with pure silver," and many other valuables. Curiously
enough O'Clery's Book of Invasions contains a poem of
seventy-two lines ascribed to this king himself, in which he
describes these articles. He was fabled to have been accompanied
on this expedition by his "bain-leannán" or fairy
sweetheart, one of an interesting race of beings of whom
frequent mention is made in Irish legend and saga.</p>

<p>The next event of consequence after the birth of Christ
is the celebrated revolt led by Cairbré Cinn-cait, of the
Athach-Tuatha,<a name="FNanchor_10_53" id="FNanchor_10_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_53" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> or unfree clans of Ireland, in other words the
serfs or plebeians, against the free clans or nobility, whom they
all but exterminated, three unborn children of noble line alone
escaping.<a name="FNanchor_11_54" id="FNanchor_11_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_54" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The people of Ireland were plagued&mdash;as though by heaven&mdash;with
bad seasons and lack of fruit during the usurper
Cairbré's reign. As the "Four Masters" graphically put it,
"evil was the state of Ireland during his reign, fruitless her
corn, for there used to be but one grain on the stalk; fishless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
her rivers; milkless her cattle; unplenty her fruit, for there
used to be but one acorn on the oak." The belief that bad
seasons were sent as a punishment of bad rulers was a very
ancient and universal one in Ireland, and continued until very
lately. The ode which the ollav or head-bard is said to have
chanted in the ears of each newly-inaugurated prince, took
care to recall it to his mind, and may be thus translated:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Seven witnesses there be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of the broken faith of kings.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">First&mdash;to trample on the free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Next&mdash;to sully sacred things,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Next&mdash;to strain the law divine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(This defeat in battle brings).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Famine, slaughter, milkless kine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And disease on flying wings.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These the seven-fold vivid lights</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That light the perjury of kings!"<a name="FNanchor_12_55" id="FNanchor_12_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_55" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>According to the Book of Conquests the people of
Ireland, plagued by famine and bad seasons, brought in, on the
death of Cairbré, the old reigning families again, making
Fearadach king, and the "Athach-Tuatha swore by the heaven
and earth, sun, moon, and all the elements, that they would
be obedient to them and their descendants, as long as the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
should surround Ireland." The land recovered its tranquillity
with the reign of Fearadach. "Good was Ireland during his
time. The seasons were right tranquil; the earth brought
forth its fruit. Fishful its river mouths; milkful the kine;
heavy-headed the woods."</p>

<p>There was a second uprising of the Athach-Tuatha later
on,<a name="FNanchor_13_56" id="FNanchor_13_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_56" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> when they massacred their masters on Moy Bolg. The
lawful heir to the throne was yet unborn at the time of this
massacre and so escaped. This was the celebrated Tuathal
[Too-a-hal, now Toole], who ultimately succeeded to the throne
and became one of the most famous of all the pre-Patrician
kings. It was he who first established or cut out the province
of Meath. The name Meath had always existed as the appellation
of a small district near which the provinces of Ulster,
Connacht, Leinster, and the two Munsters joined. Tuathal cut
off from each of the four provinces the angles adjoining it, and
out of these he constituted a new province<a name="FNanchor_14_57" id="FNanchor_14_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_57" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> to be thenceforth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
special estate, demesne, and inheritance of the High-kings of
Ireland. He built, or rebuilt, four palaces in the four quarters
of the district he had thus annexed, all of them celebrated in
after times&mdash;of which more later on. It was he also who,
under evil auspices and in an evil hour, extorted from Leinster
the first Borumha,<a name="FNanchor_15_58" id="FNanchor_15_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_58" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> or Boru tribute,&mdash;<i>nomen infaustum</i>&mdash;a
step which contributed so powerfully to mould upon lines
of division and misery the history of our unhappy country
from that day until the present, by estranging the province of
Leinster, throwing it into the arms of foreigners, and causing
it to put itself into opposition to the rest of Ireland. This
unhappy tribute, of which we shall hear more later on, was
imposed during the reigns of forty kings.</p>

<p>Thirteen years after the death of Tuathal, Cáthaoir [Cauheer],
celebrated for his Will or Testament,<a name="FNanchor_16_59" id="FNanchor_16_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_59" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> reigned; he was
of pure Leinster blood, and the men of that province have
always felicitated themselves upon having given at least this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
one great king to Ireland. It is from him that the great
Leinster families&mdash;the O'Tooles, O'Byrnes, Mac Morroughs
or Murphys, O'Conor Falys, O'Gormans, and others&mdash;descend.
He was slain, A.D. 123, by Conn of the Hundred Battles.<a name="FNanchor_17_60" id="FNanchor_17_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_60" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>There are few kings during the three hundred years preceding
and following the birth of Christ more famous than this
Conn, and there is a very large body of saga collected round
him and his rival Eoghan [Owen], the king of Munster who
succeeded in wresting half the sovereignty from him. As the
result of their conflicts that part of Ireland which lies north
of the Escir Riada,<a name="FNanchor_18_61" id="FNanchor_18_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_61" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> or, roughly speaking, that lies north of a
line drawn from Dublin to Galway, has from that day to this
been known as Conn's Half, and that south of the same line as
Owen's Half. Owen was at last slain by him of the hundred
battles at the fight of Moy Léana.</p>

<p>Owen, as we have seen, was never King of Ireland, but he
left behind him a famous son, Oilioll<a name="FNanchor_19_62" id="FNanchor_19_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_62" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Olum, who was married
to Sadhbh,<a name="FNanchor_20_63" id="FNanchor_20_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_63" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the daughter of his rival and vanquisher, Conn of
the Hundred Battles, and it is to this stem that nearly all the
ruling families of Munster trace themselves. From his eldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
son, Owen Mór, come the Mac Carthys, O'Sullivans, O'Keefes,
O'Callaghans, etc.; from his second son come the Mac Namaras
and Clancys; and from his third son, Cian,<a name="FNanchor_21_64" id="FNanchor_21_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_64" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> come the so-called
tribes of the Cianachts, the O'Carrolls, O'Meaghers, O'Haras,
O'Garas, Caseys, the southern O'Conors, and others. There is a
considerable body of romance gathered around this Oilioll and his
sons and wife, chiefly connected with the kingship of Munster.</p>

<p>Conn's son, Art the Lonely&mdash;so-called because he survived
after the slaughter of his brothers&mdash;was slain by Mac Con,
Sive's son by her first husband, and the slayer ruled in his place,
being the third king of the line of the Ithians, of whom we
shall read later on, who came to the throne.</p>

<p>He, however, was himself killed at the instigation of Cormac,
son of Art, or Cormac mac Art, as he is usually designated.
This Cormac is a central figure of the large cycle of stories
connected with Finn and the Fenians. He was at last slain
in the battle of Moy Mochruime. His advice to a prince,
addressed to his son Cairbré of the Liffey, will be noticed later
on, and, so far as it may be genuine, bears witness to his
reputed wisdom, "as do the many other praiseworthy institutes
named from him that are still to be found among the books
of the Brehon Laws."<a name="FNanchor_22_65" id="FNanchor_22_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_65" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This Cormac it was who built the
first mill in Ireland, and who made a banqueting-place of the
great hall of Mi-Cuarta,<a name="FNanchor_23_66" id="FNanchor_23_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_66" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> at Tara, which was one hundred
yards long, forty-five feet high, one hundred feet broad, and
which was entered by fourteen doors. The site is still to be
seen, but no vestige of the building, which, like all early Irish
structures, was of wood.</p>

<p>Cairbré of the Liffey succeeded his father Cormac, and it
was he who fought the battle of Gabhra (Gowra) with the
Fenians, in which he himself was slain, but in which he broke,
and for ever, the power of that unruly body of warriors.</p>

<p>About the year 331 the great Ulster city and palace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Emania, which had been the home of Conor and the Red
Branch knights, and the capital of Ulster for six hundred
years, was taken and burnt to the ground by the Three Collas,
who thus become the ancestors of a number of the tribes
of modern Ulster. From one of them descend the
Mac Mahons, the ruling family of Monaghan; the Maguires,
barons of Fermanagh; and the O'Hanlons, chiefs of Orior;
while another was the ancestor of the Mac Donalds of Antrim
and the Isles, of the Mac Dugalds, and the Mac Rories. The old
nobility of Ulster, whose capital had been Emania, were thrust
aside into the north-east corner of Ulster, whence most of
them were expelled by the planters of James I.</p>

<p>We now come to Eochaidh [Yohee] Muigh-mheadhoin
[Mwee-va-on] who was father of the celebrated Niall of the
Nine Hostages. From one of his sons, Brian, come the Ui
[Ee] Briain, that is, the collection of families composed of
the seed of Brian&mdash;the O'Conors, kings of Connacht; the
Mac Dermots, princes of Moylurg, afterwards of Coolavin;
the O'Rorkes, princes of Breffny; the O'Reillys, O'Flaherties,
and Mac Donaghs. From another son of his, Fiachrach, come
the Ui Fiachrach, who were for ages the rivals of the Ui
Briain in contesting the sovereignty of Connacht&mdash;the
O'Shaughnesies were one of the principal families representing
this sept.<a name="FNanchor_24_67" id="FNanchor_24_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_67" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Eochaidh Muigh-mheadhoin was succeeded in 366<a name="FNanchor_25_68" id="FNanchor_25_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_68" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> by
Crimhthan [Crivhan], who was one of those militant Scots at
whose hands the unhappy Britons suffered so sorely. He
"gained victories," say the annals, "and extended his sway
over Alba, Britain, and Gaul," which probably means that he
raided all three, and possibly made settlements in South-west
Britain. He was poisoned by his sister in the hope that the
sovereignty would fall to her favourite son Brian. In this,
however, she was disappointed, and it is a noticeable fact in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Irish history that none of the Ui Briain, or great Connacht
families, ever sat upon the throne of Ireland, with the exception
of Turlough O'Conor, third last king of Ireland, ancestor
of the present O'Conor Don, and Roderick O'Conor, the
last of all the High-kings of the island.</p>

<p>Brian being set aside, Niall of the Nine Hostages ascended
the throne in 379. It was he who first assisted the Dál Riada
clans to gain supremacy over the Picts of Scotland. These
Dál Riada were descended from a grandson, on the mother's
side, of Conn of the Hundred Battles. There were two septs
of these Dál Riada, one settled in Ulster and the other in Alba
[Scotland]. It was from the conquests<a name="FNanchor_26_69" id="FNanchor_26_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_69" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> achieved by the Scots
[<i>i.e.</i> Milesians] of Ireland that Alba was called Lesser Scotia.
In course of ages the inconvenient distinction of the countries
into Lesser and Greater Scotia died away, but the name
Scotia, or Scotland, without any qualifying adjective, clung to
the lesser country to the frightful confusion of historians,
while the greater remained known to foreigners as Erin, or
Hibernia.<a name="FNanchor_27_70" id="FNanchor_27_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_70" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This Niall was surnamed "of the Nine Hostages,"
from his having extorted hostages from nine minor kings. He
mercilessly plundered Britain and Gaul. The Picts and Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Gaels combined had at one time penetrated as far as London and
Kent, when Theodosius drove them back.<a name="FNanchor_28_71" id="FNanchor_28_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_71" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It was probably
against Niall that Stilicho gained those successes so magniloquently
eulogised by Claudian, "when the Scot moved all
Ierne against us and the sea foamed under his hostile
oars." Niall had eight sons, from whom the famous Ui [Ee]
Neill are all descended. One branch of these, the branch
descended from his son Owen, took the name of O'Neill in the
eleventh century, not from him of the Nine Hostages, but from
King Niall of the Black Knee, a less remote ancestor, of whom
more later on. This was the great family of the Tyrone
O'Neills. So solidly did the posterity of Niall establish itself,
and upon so firm a basis was his power perpetuated, that
almost all the following kings of Ireland were descended from
him, besides multitudes of illustrious families, "nearly three
hundred of his descendants, eminent for their learning and the
sanctity of their lives," says O'Flaherty, "have been enrolled
in the catalogue of the saints."<a name="FNanchor_29_72" id="FNanchor_29_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_72" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He it was who, while plundering
in Britain or Armorica, led back amongst other
captives the youth, then sixteen years old, who was destined,
under the title of the Holy Patrick, to revolutionise Ireland.</p>

<p>St. Patrick's own "Confession" and his Epistle to Coroticus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
have come down to us&mdash;the former preserved in the Book or
Armagh, a manuscript copied by a scribe named Ferdomnach
in 807 (or 812 according to a truer chronology), apparently
from St. Patrick's own copy, for at the end of the Confession
the scribe adds this note: "Thus far the volume which Patrick
wrote with his own hand."<a name="FNanchor_30_73" id="FNanchor_30_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_73" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In this ancient manuscript (itself
only a copy of older ones so damaged as to be almost illegible<a name="FNanchor_31_74" id="FNanchor_31_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_74" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
to the scribe who copied them in 807, a little more than three
hundred years after St. Patrick's death), we find nearly a dozen
mentions of Niall of the Nine Hostages, of his son Laeghaire
[Leary], and several more who lived before St. Patrick's arrival,
and so find ourselves for the first time upon tolerably solid
historical ground, which from this out never deserts us. St.
Columcille, the evangeliser of the Picts and the founder of
Iona, was the great-great-grandson of this Niall, and the great-grandson
of Conall Gulban, so celebrated even to this day in
Irish romance and history.<a name="FNanchor_32_75" id="FNanchor_32_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_75" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Ascertainable authenticated Irish history, then, begins with
Niall and with Patrick, but in this chapter we have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
behind it to see what may be learned from native sources&mdash;rather
traditional than historical&mdash;of Irish life and history, from
the founding of Emania three hundred years before Christ
down to the coming of St. Patrick. But for all the things
which we have recounted we have no independent external
testimony, nor have we now any manuscripts remaining of
which we could say, "We have here documentary evidence
fifteen or twenty centuries old attesting the truth of these
things." No; we are entirely dependent for all that pre-Patrician
history upon native evidence alone, and that evidence
has come down to us chiefly but not entirely in manuscripts
copied in the twelfth and in later centuries.</p>

<i>I.e.</i>, "Dearth, servitude, want of provisions, plagues, wars, conflicts, defeat
in battle, rough weather, rapine, through the falsity of a prince they
arise." I find a curious extension of this idea in a passage in the "Annals
of Loch Cé" under the year 1568, which is recorded as "a cold stormy
year of scarcity, and this is little wonder, for it was in it Mac Diarmada
(Dermot) died"!</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_13_56" id="Footnote_13_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_56"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> There is a rather suspicious parallelism between these two risings,
which would make it appear as though part at least of the story had been
reduplicated. First Cairbré Cinn-Cait, and the Athach-Tuatha, in the year
10, slay the nobles of Ireland, but Fearadach escapes in his mother's womb.
His mother was daughter of the King of Alba. After five years of famine
Cairbré dies and Fearadach comes back and reigns. Again, in the year
56, Fiachaidh, the legitimate king, is slain by the provincial kings at the
instigation of the Athach-Tuatha, in the slaughter of Moy Bolg. His
unborn son also escapes in the womb of his mother. This mother is also
daughter of the King of Alba. Elim the usurper reigns, but God again
takes vengeance, and during the time that Elim was in the sovereignty
Ireland was "without corn, without milk, without fruit, without fish," etc.
Again, on the death of Elim the legitimate son comes to the throne, and
the seasons right themselves. Keating's account agrees with this except
that he misplaces Cairbré's reign. There probably were two uprisings of
the servile tribes against their Celtic masters, but some of the events
connected with the one may have been reduplicated by the annalists.
O'Donovan, in his fine edition of the "Four Masters," does not notice this
parallelism.</p></div>

<h4>HOW FAR CAN NATIVE SOURCES BE RELIED ON?</h4>


<p>It must next be considered what amount of reliance can be
placed upon the Irish annals and annalists, who have preserved
to us our early history. If, in those few cases where we happen
to have some credible external evidences of early events, we find
our native annalists notoriously at variance with such evidences,
our faith in them must of necessity be shaken. If, on the other
hand, we find them to coincide fairly well with these other
accounts taken from foreign sources, we shall be inclined to
place all the more reliance on their accuracy when they record
events upon which no such sidelights can be thrown.</p>

<p>Now, from the nature of the case, it is exceedingly difficult,
considering how isolated Ireland was while evolving her own
civilisation, and considering how little in early ages her internal
affairs clashed with those of Europe, to find any specific events
of which we have early external evidence. We can, for instance,
apart from our own annals and poems, procure no corroborative
evidence of the division of Ireland between Conn and
Owen, of the destruction of Emania by the Three Collas, or of
the battle of Gabhra. But despite the silence upon Irish affairs
of ancient foreign writers, we have luckily another class of
proof of the highest possible value, brought to light by the discoveries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of modern science, and powerfully strengthening the
credibility of our annals. This is nothing less than the record
of natural phenomena. If we find, on calculating backwards,
as modern science has enabled us to do, that such events as the
appearance of comets or the occurrence of eclipses are recorded
to the day and hour by the annalists, we can know with something
like certainty that these phenomena <i>were recorded at the
time of their appearance by writers who observed them</i>, whose
writings must have been actually consulted and seen by those
later annalists, whose books we now possess. Nobody could
think of saying of natural phenomena thus accurately recorded,
as they might of mere historical narratives, that they were
handed down by tradition only, and reduced to writing for the
first time many centuries later. Now it so happens that the
Annals of Ulster, annals which treat of Ireland and Irish history
from about the year 444, but of which the written copy
dates only from the fifteenth century, contain from the year
496 to 884, as many as 18 records of eclipses and comets
which agree exactly even to the day and hour with the
calculations of modern astronomers. How impossible it is
to keep such records unless written memoranda are made of
them by eye-witnesses, is shown by the fact that Bede, born
himself in 675, in recording the great solar eclipse which took
place only eleven years before his own birth is yet two days
astray in his date; while, on the other hand, the Ulster annals
give not only the correct day but the correct hour&mdash;thus
showing that Cathal Maguire, their compiler, had access
either to the original or to a copy of the original account of an
eye-witness.<a name="FNanchor_1_76" id="FNanchor_1_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_76" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Again, we occasionally find the early records of the two great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
branches of the Celtic race, the Gaelic and the Cymric, throwing
a mutual light upon each other. There exists, for instance, an
ancient Irish saga, of which several versions have come down
to us, a saga well known in Irish literature under the
title of the Expulsion of the Dési,<a name="FNanchor_2_77" id="FNanchor_2_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_77" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which, according to
Zimmer&mdash;than whom there can be no better authority&mdash;was,
judging from its linguistic forms, committed to writing in the
eighth century. The Dési were a tribe settled in Bregia, in
Meath, and the Annals<a name="FNanchor_3_78" id="FNanchor_3_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_78" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> tell us that the great Cormac mac
Art defeated them in seven battles, forcing them to emigrate and
seek new homes. This composition describes their wanderings
in detail. Some of the tribe we are told migrated to Munster,
whilst another portion crossed the Irish Sea and settled down
in that part of South Wales called Dyfed, under the leadership
of one Eochaidh [Yohy], thence called "from-over-sea." There
Eochaidh with his sons and grand-children lived and died, and
propagated themselves to the time of the writer, who states
that they were then&mdash;at the time he wrote&mdash;ruled over by one
Teudor mac Regin, king of Dyfed, who was then alive, and
whose pedigree is traced in fourteen generations up to the
father of that Eochaidh who had led them over in Cormac mac
Art's time. Taking a generation as 33 years, and starting with
the year 270, about the time of the expulsion of the Dési, we
find that Teudor Mac Regin should have reigned about the
year 730, and the Irish saga must have been written at this
time, which agrees with Zimmer's reckoning, although his
computation is based on purely linguistic grounds. That school
of interpreters who decry all ancient Irish history as a mixture
of mythology and fiction, and who can see in Cormac mac
Art only a sun-god, would probably ascribe the expulsion of the
Dési and other records of a similar nature to the creative imagination
of the later Irish, who, they hold, invented their genealogies
as they did their history. But in this case it happens by
the merest accident that we <i>have</i> collateral evidence of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
events, for in a Welsh pedigree of Ellen, mother of Owen, son
of Howel Dda, preserved in a manuscript of the eleventh century,
this same Teudor is mentioned, and his genealogy traced
back by the Welsh scribe; the names of eleven of his ancestors,
corresponding&mdash;except for inconsiderable orthographical differences&mdash;with
those preserved in the ancient Irish text.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When we consider," says Dr. Kuno Meyer, "that these Welsh
names passed through the hands of who knows how many Irish
scribes, one must marvel that they have preserved their forms so
well;" and he adds, "in the light of this evidence alone, I have no
hesitation in saying that the settlement of an Irish tribe in Dyfed
during the latter half of the third century must be considered a well-authenticated
fact."<a name="FNanchor_4_79" id="FNanchor_4_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_79" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Reeves cites another remarkable case of undesigned coincidence
which strongly testifies to the accuracy of the Irish
annalists. In the Antiphonary of Bangor, an ancient service
book still preserved on the Continent, we find the names of
fifteen abbots of the celebrated monastery of Bangor&mdash;at which
the heresiarch Pelagius was probably educated&mdash;and these
fifteen abbots are recorded by the same names and in the same
order as in the Annals; "and this undesigned coincidence," says
Reeves, "is the more interesting because the testimonies are
perfectly independent, the one being afforded by Irish records
which never left the kingdom, and the other by a Latin composition
which has been a thousand years absent from the
country where it was written."</p>

<p>Another incidental proof of the accuracy of early Irish
literary records is afforded by the fact that on the few occasions
where the Saxon Bede, when making mention of some
Scot, <i>i.e.</i>, Irishman, gives also the name of his father, this
name coincides with that given by the annals.</p>

<p>We may, then, take it, without any credulity on our part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
that Irish history as drawn from native sources may be very
well relied upon from about the middle of the fourth century.
Beyond that date, going backwards, we have no means at our
disposal for checking its accuracy or inaccuracy, no means of
determining the truth of such events as the struggle between
Conn and Owen, between the Fenian bands and the High-king,
between Ulster under Conor and Connacht under
Mève, no means of determining the actual existence of
Conairé the Great, or of Cuchulain, or of the heroes of the
Red Branch, or of Finn mac Cúmhail [Cool] and his son
Ossian and his grandson Oscar. Is there any solid ground
for treating these things as objective history?</p>

<p>It has been urged that it is unphilosophic of us and was
unphilosophic of the annalist Tighearnach to fix the reign of
Cimbaeth<a name="FNanchor_5_80" id="FNanchor_5_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_80" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> [Kimbæ], who built Emania, the capital of
Ulster, some three hundred years before Christ, as a terminus
from which we may begin to place some confidence in Irish
accounts, seeing that the Annals carry back the list of Irish
kings with apparently equal certainty for centuries past him,
and back even to the coming of the Milesians, which took
place at the lowest computation some six or seven hundred
years before. All that can be said in answer to this, is to
point out that there must have been hundreds of documents
existing at the time when Tighearnach wrote, "the countless
hosts of the illuminated books of the men of Erin," as his contemporary
Angus called them&mdash;records of the past which he
was able to examine and consult, but which we are not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Tighearnach was a professed annalist, "a modern but cautious
chronicler,"<a name="FNanchor_6_81" id="FNanchor_6_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_81" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and for his age a very well-instructed man, and
it seems evident that he would not have placed the founding
of Emania as a terminus <i>a quo</i> if he had not inferred rightly or
wrongly that native accounts could be fairly trusted from that
forward. It certainly creates some feeling of confidence to
find him pushing aside as uncertain and unproven the arid roll
of kings so confidently carried back for hundreds of years
before his starting-point. The historic sense was well
developed in Tighearnach, and he no doubt discredited these
far-reaching claims either because he could not find sufficiently
early documentary evidence to corroborate them, or more
likely because such accounts as he had access to, began to
contradict one another and were unable to stand any scrutiny
from this time backwards. With him it was probably largely
a question of documents. But this brings us at once to the
question, when did the Irish learn the use of letters and begin
to write, to which we shall turn our attention in a future
chapter.</p>

non-Irish portions of his annals Tighearnach used, as Stokes has shown,
St. Jerome's "Interpretatio Chronicæ Eusebii Pamphili," the seven books
of the history of Paulus Orosius, "The Chronicon, or Account of the Six
Ages of the World," in Bede's Works, "The Vulgate," "The Etymologarium,"
"Libri XX of Isodorus Hispalensis," Josephus' "Antiquities of
the Jews," probably in a Latin translation, and perhaps the lost Chronicon
of Julius Africanus.</p></div>

<h4>THE PRE-MILESIAN FABLE AND EARLY PANTHEON</h4>


<p>In investigating the very early history of Ireland we are met
with a mass of pseudo-historic narrative and myth, woven
together into an apparently homogeneous whole, and all now
posing as real history. This is backed up, and eked out, by a
most elaborate system of genealogy closely interwoven with
it, which, together with a good share of the topographical
nomenclature of the island, is there to add its entire influence
to that of historian and annalist in apparently attesting the
truth of what these latter have recorded.</p>

<p>If in seeking for a path through this maze we grasp the
skirt of the genealogist and follow his steps for a clue, we shall
find ourselves, in tracing into the past the ancestry of any
Milesian chief, invariably landed at the foot of some one
of four persons, three of them, Ir, Eber, Eremon,<a name="FNanchor_1_82" id="FNanchor_1_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_82" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> being sons
of that Milesius who made the Milesian conquest, and the
fourth being Lughaidh [Lewy], son of Ith, who was a
nephew of the same. On one or other of these four does the
genealogy of every chief and prince abut, so that all end
ultimately in Milesius.</p>

<p>Milesius' own genealogy and the wanderings of his ancestors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
are also recounted for many generations before they land in
Ireland, but during this pre-Milesian period there are no side-genealogies,
the ancestors of Milesius himself alone are given,
traced through twenty-two apparently Gaelic names and
thirteen Hebrew ones, passing through Japhet and ending in
Adam. It is only with the landing of the three sons and
the nephew of Milesius that the ramifications of Irish genealogies
begin, and they are backed up by the whole weight of
the Irish topographical system which is shot through and
through with places named after personages and events of the
early Milesian period, and of the period of the Tuatha De
Danann.</p>

<p>It will be well to give here a brief <i>résumé</i> of the accounts of
the Milesians' wanderings before they arrived in Ireland. Briefly
then the Gaels are traced back all the way to Fenius Farsa, a
king of Scythia, who is then easily traced up to Adam. But
beginning with this Fenius Farsa we find that he started a
great school for learning languages. His son was Niul, who
also taught languages, and his son again was Gaedhal, from
whom the Gaels are so called. This Niul went into Egypt
and married Scota, daughter of Pharaoh. This is a post-Christian
invention, which is not satisfied without bringing
Niul into contact with Aaron, whom he befriended, in return
for which Moses healed his son Gaedhal from the bite of a
serpent. Since then says an ancient verse&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"No serpent nor vile venomed thing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can live upon the Gaelic soil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No bard nor stranger since has found</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A cold repulse from a son of Gaedhal."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Gaedhal's son was Esru, whose son was Sru, and when the
Egyptians oppressed them he and his people emigrated to
Crete. His son was Eber Scot, from whom some say the
Gaels were called Scots, but most of the Irish antiquarians
maintain that they are called Scots because they once came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
from Scythia,<a name="FNanchor_2_83" id="FNanchor_2_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_83" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to which cradle of the race Eber Scot led the
nation back again. Expelled from Scythia a couple of generations
later the race plant themselves in the country of Gaethluighe,
where they were ruled over by one called Eber of
the White Knee. The eighth in descent from him emigrated
with four ships to Spain. His son was Breogan, who built
Brigantia. His grandson was Golamh, called Miledh Easpáin,
<i>i.e.</i>, Warrior of Spain,<a name="FNanchor_3_84" id="FNanchor_3_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_84" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> whose name has been universally, but
badly, Latinised Milesius, and it was his three sons and his
nephew who landed in Ireland and who planted there the
Milesian people. Milesius himself never put foot in Ireland,
but he seems in his own person to have epitomised the
wanderings of his race, for we find him returning to Scythia,
making his way thence into Egypt, marrying Scota, a daughter
of Pharaoh, and finally returning to Spain.</p>

<p>Much or all of this pre-Milesian account of the race must be
unhesitatingly set down to the influence of Christianity, and
to the invention of early Christian bards who felt a desire to
trace their kings back to Japhet.<a name="FNanchor_4_85" id="FNanchor_4_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_85" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The native unchristianised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
genealogies all converge in the sons and nephew of Milesius.
The legends of their exploits and those of their successors are
the real race-heritage of the Gael, unmixed with the fanciful
Christian allusions and Hebraic adulterations of the pre-Milesian
story, which was the last to be invented.</p>

<p>The genuine and early combination of Irish myth and history
centres not on foreign but on Irish soil, in the accounts of the
Nemedians, the Firbolg, the Tuatha De Danann, and the early
Milesians, accounts which have been handed down to us in short
stories and more lengthy sagas, as well as in the bold brief
chronicles of the annalists. No doubt the stories of the landing
of his race on Irish soil, and the exploits of his first chieftains were
familiar in the early days to every Gael. They became, as it
were, part and parcel of his own life and being, and were preserved
with something approaching a religious veneration. His
belief in them entered into his whole political and social system,
the holding of his tribe-lands was bound up with it, and a highly-paid
and influential class of bardic historians was subsidised
with the express purpose of propagating these traditions and
maintaining them unaltered.</p>

<p>Everything around him recalled to the early Gael the
traditional history of his own past. The two hills of Slieve
Luachra in Kerry he called the paps of Dana,<a name="FNanchor_5_86" id="FNanchor_5_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_86" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and he knew
that Dana was the mother of the gods Brian, Iuchar, and
Iucharba, the story of whose sufferings, at the hands of Lugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the Long-handed, has in later times so often drawn tears from
its auditors. When he beheld the mighty barrows piled upon
the banks of the Boyne,<a name="FNanchor_6_87" id="FNanchor_6_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_87" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he knew that it was over the
Dagda&mdash;an Irish Jupiter&mdash;and over his three sons<a name="FNanchor_7_88" id="FNanchor_7_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_88" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that they
were heaped; and one of these, Angus of the Boyne, was, down
to the present century, reverenced as the presiding genius of the
spot. The mighty monuments of Knock Áine in Limerick,
and Knock Gréine, as well as those of Knowth, Dowth, and
New Grange, were all connected with his legendary past. It
was Lugh of the Tuatha De Danann, he knew, who had first
established the great fair of Tailltin,<a name="FNanchor_8_89" id="FNanchor_8_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_89" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to which he and his
friends went from year to year to meet each other, and contract
alliances for their grown children. The great funeral mound,
round which the games were held, was sacred to Talti, the foster-mother
of Lugh, who had there been buried, and in whose
honour the games in which he participated were held upon the
day which he called&mdash;and still calls, though he has now forgotten
why&mdash;Lughnasa or Lugh's gathering.<a name="FNanchor_9_90" id="FNanchor_9_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_90" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> His own
country he called&mdash;and still calls&mdash;by the various names of
Eire, Fódhla [Fola], and Banba, and they, as he knew, were
three queens<a name="FNanchor_10_91" id="FNanchor_10_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_91" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of the Tuatha De Danann. The Gael of
Connacht knew that Moycullen, near Galway, was so named
from Uillin, a grandson of the Tuatha De Danann king
Nuada; and Loch Corrib from Orbsen, the other name of the
sea-god Manannán, slain there by this Uillin, and each of the
provinces was studded with such memorials.</p>

<p>The early Milesian invaders left their names just as closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
imprinted upon our topography as did their predecessors the
Tuatha De Danann. The great plain of Bregia in Meath was
so called from Brega, son of that Breogan who built Brigantia.
Slieve Cualann in Wicklow&mdash;now hideously and absurdly called
the Great Sugar Loaf!&mdash;is named from Cuala, another son of
Breogan; Slieve Bladhma, or Bloom, is called from another son
of the same; and from yet another is named the Plain of
Muirthemni, where was fought the great battle in which fell
Cuchulain "fortissimus heros Scotorum." The south of
Munster is called Corca Luighe from Lughaidh, son of Ith,
nephew of Milesius. The harbour of Drogheda was called
Inver Colpa, from Colpa of the sword, another son of Milesius,
who was there drowned when trying to effect a landing.
The Carlingford Mountains were called Slieve Cualgni, and
a well-known mountain in Armagh Slieve Fuad, from two
more sons of Breogan of Brigantia, slain after the second
battle with the Tuatha De Danann, while they followed up
the chase. The sandhills in the west of Munster, where
Donn, the eldest son of Milesius, was shipwrecked and lost his
life&mdash;as did his whole crew consisting as is said of twenty-four
warriors, five chiefs, twelve women, four servants, eight
rowers, and fifty youths-in-training&mdash;is called Donn's House.
So vivid is this tradition even still, that we find a Munster poet
as late as the last century addressing a poem to this Donn as
the tutelary divinity of the place, and asking him to take him
into his sidh [shee] or fairy mound and become his patron.
This poem is remarkable, as showing that in popular opinion
the early Milesians shared the character of sub-gods, fairies, or
beings of supernatural power, in common with the Tuatha
De Danann themselves, for the poet treats him as still living
and reigning in state, as peer of Angus of the Boyne, and
cousin of Cliona, queen of the Munster fairies.<a name="FNanchor_11_92" id="FNanchor_11_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_92" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Wherever he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
turned the Gael was thus confronted with scenes from his own
past, or with customs&mdash;like the August games at Tailltin&mdash;deliberately
established to perpetuate them.</p>

<p>In process of time, partly perhaps through the rationalising
influences of a growing civilisation, but chiefly through the
direct action of Christianity, with which he came into active
contact in perhaps the fourth, or certainly in the fifth century,
the remembrance of the old Gaelic theogony, and the old
Gaelic deities and his religious belief in them became blunted,
and although no small quantity of matter that is purely pagan,
and an immense amount of matter, but slightly tinged with
Christianity, has been handed down to us, yet gods, heroes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and men have been so far brought to a common level, that it
is next to impossible at first sight to disentangle them or to say
which is which.</p>

<p>Very probably there was, even before the introduction of
Christianity, no sharply-defined line of demarcation drawn
between gods and heroes, that, in the words of Pindar, &#7955;&#957;
&#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#8182;&#957; &#7955;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#8182;&#957; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;, "one was the race of gods and men,"
and when in after times the early mythical history of Ireland
came to be committed to parchment, its historians saw in the
Irish pantheon nothing but a collection of human beings. It
is thus, no doubt, that we find the Fomorians and the Tuatha
De Danann posing as real people, whilst in reality it is more
than likely that they figured in the scheme of Gaelic mythology
as races of beneficent gods and of evil deities, or at least as
races of superhuman power.</p>

<p>The early Irish writers who redacted the mythical history
of the country were no doubt imbued with the spirit of the
so-called Greek "logographers," who, when collecting the
Grecian myths from the poets, desired, while not eliminating
the miraculous, yet to smooth away all startling discrepancies
and present them in a readable and, as it were, a historical
series.<a name="FNanchor_12_93" id="FNanchor_12_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_93" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Others no doubt wished to rationalise the early myths
so far as they conveniently could, as even Herodotus shows an
inclination to do with regard to the Greek marvels; and the
later annalists and poets of the Irish went as far as ever went
Euhemerus, reducing gods and heroes alike to the level of
common men.</p>

<p>We find Keating, who composed in Irish his Forus Feasa
or History, in the first half of the seventeenth century,
and who only re-writes or abbreviates what he found before
him in the ancient books of the Gaels now lost, distracted
between his desire to euhemerise&mdash;in other words, to make
mere men of the gods and heroes&mdash;and his unflinching fidelity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to his ancient texts. Thus he professes to give the names of
"the most famous and <i>noble persons</i> of the Tuatha De Danann,"
and amongst them he mentions "the six sons of Delbaeth, son
of Ogma, namely, Fiacadh, Ollamh, Indaei, <i>Brian, Iuchar,</i>
and <i>Iucharba</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_13_94" id="FNanchor_13_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_94" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but in another place he quotes this verse from
some of his ancient sources&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Brian Iucharba and the great Iuchar,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The <i>three gods</i> of the sacred race of Dana,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fell at Mana on the resistless sea</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the hand of Lughaidh, son of Ethlenn."</span><br />
</p>

<p>These whom the ancient verse distinctly designates as gods,
Keating makes merely "noble persons," but at the very same
time in treating of the De Danann he interpolates amongst his
list of their notable men and women this curious sentence:<a name="FNanchor_14_95" id="FNanchor_14_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_95" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
"The following are the names of three of their goddesses, viz.,
Badhbh [Bive], Macha, and Morighan."<a name="FNanchor_15_96" id="FNanchor_15_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_96" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>There are many allusions to the old Irish pantheon in
Cormac's Glossary, which is a compilation of the ninth or tenth
century explanatory of expressions which had even at that early
date become obscure or obsolete, and many of these are evidently
of pagan origin. Cormac describes Ana as <i>mater deorum hibernensium</i>,
the mother of the Irish gods, and he adds, "Well
used she to nourish the gods, it is from her name is said 'anæ,'
<i>i.e.</i>, abundance, and from her name is called the two paps of
Ana." Buanann, says Cormac, was the "nurse of heroes," as
"Anu was mother of the gods, so Buanann was mother of the
'Fiann.'" Etán was nurse of the poets. Brigit, of which
we have now made a kind of national Christian name, was in
pagan times a female poet, daughter of the Dagda. Her
divinity is evident from what Cormac says of her, namely, that
"she was a goddess whom poets worshipped, for very great
and very noble was her superintendence, therefore call they
her goddess of poets by this name, whose sisters were Brigit,
woman of smith-work, and Brigit, woman of healing, namely,
goddesses&mdash;from whose names Brigit<a name="FNanchor_16_97" id="FNanchor_16_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_97" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was with all Irishmen
called a goddess," <i>i.e.</i>, the terms "Brigit" and "goddess" were
synonymous (?) The name itself he derives fancifully from
the words <i>breo-shaighit</i>, "fiery arrow," as though the inspirations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of a poet pierced like fiery arrows. Diancécht Cormac calls
"the sage of the leech-craft of Ireland," but in the next line
we read that he was so called because he was "Dia na cécht,"
<i>i.e.</i>, Deus salutis, or god of health. Zeuss quotes an incantation
to this god from a manuscript which is, he says, at least a
thousand years old. His daughter was Etán, an artificer, one
of whose sayings is quoted by Cormac. Néith was the god of
battle among the Irish pagans, Nemon was his wife. The
euhemerising tendency comes out strongly in Cormac's
account of Manannán, a kind of Irish Proteus and Neptune
combined, who according to him was "a renowned trader
who dwelt in the Isle of Man, he was the best pilot in the
West of Europe; through acquaintance with the sky he knew
the quarter in which would be fair weather and foul weather,
and when each of these two seasons would change. Hence
the Scots and Britons called him a god of the sea. Thence,
too, they said he was the sea's son&mdash;Mac Lir, <i>i.e.</i>, son of the
sea."</p>

<p>Another ancient Irish gloss<a name="FNanchor_17_98" id="FNanchor_17_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_98" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> alludes to the mysterious
Mór-rígan or war-goddess, of whom we shall hear more later
on; and to Machæ, another war-goddess, "of whom is said
Machæ's mast-feeding," meaning thereby, "the heads of men
that have been slaughtered."</p>

<p>From all that we have said it clearly appears that carefully
as the Christianised Irish strove to euhemerise their pantheon,
they were unable to succeed. If, as Keating acknowledges,
Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharba were gods, then <i>à fortiori</i> much
more so must have been the more famous Lugh, who compassed
their death, and the Dagda, and Angus Óg. Keating himself,
in giving us a list of the famous Tuatha De Danann has
probably given us also the names of a large number of primitive
Celtic deities&mdash;not that these were at all confined to the De
Danann tribes.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that there is no mention of temples nor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
churches dedicated to these Irish gods, nor do we find any of
those inscriptions to them which are so common in Gaul,
Belgium, Switzerland, and even Britain, but they appear from
passages in Cormac's Glossary<a name="FNanchor_18_99" id="FNanchor_18_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_99" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to have had altars and images
dedicated to them.</p>

<p>We are forced, then, to come to the conclusion that the
pagan Irish once possessed a large pantheon, probably as highly
organised as that of the Scandinavians, but owing to their
earlier and completer conversion to Christianity only traces of
it now remain.</p>

and the narrative of the <i>peritissimi Scotorum</i> as his authorities for deducing
the Scots, <i>i.e.</i> Irish, from a family of Scythia, who fled out of Egypt with
the children of Israel, which shows that the original narrative had
assumed this Christian form in the eighth century. In the Book of
Invasions&mdash;the earliest MS. of which is of the twelfth century&mdash;the Christian
invention has made considerable strides, and we start from Magog, Japhet,
and Noah, and from the Tower of Babel pass into Egypt. Nel or Niul is
called from the Plain of Senaar to the Court of Pharaoh, and marries his
daughter Scota, and their son is named Gaedhal. They have their own
exodus, and arrive in Scythia after many adventures; thence into Spain,
where Breogan built the tower from whose top Ireland was seen. It would
seem from this that the later writer of the Book of Invasions enhanced the
simpler account which the Irish had given Nennius three or four centuries
before. Zimmer, however, thinks that Nennius quoted from a preceding
Book of Invasions now lost.</p></div>

<h4>EVIDENCE OF TOPOGRAPHY AND GENEALOGY</h4>


<p>The ramifications of early Irish literary history and its claims
to antiquity are so multiple, intricate, and inter-connected, that
it is difficult for any one who has not made a close study of it
to form a conception of the extent it covers and the various
districts it embraces. The early literature of Ireland is so
bound up with the early history, and the history so bound up and
associated with tribal names, memorial sites, patronymics, and
topographical nomenclature, that it presents a kind of heterogeneous
whole, that which is recognised history running into
and resting upon suspected or often even evident myth, while
tribal patronymics and national genealogies abut upon both,
and the whole is propped and supported by legions of place-names
still there to testify, as it were, to the truth of all.</p>

<p>We have already glanced at some of the marks left by
the mysterious De Danann race upon our nomenclature.
Mounds, raths, and tumuli, called after them, dot all Ireland.
It is the same with the early Milesians. It is the same
with the men of the great pseudo-historic cycle of story-telling,
that of Cuchulain and the Red Branch, not to speak of
minor cycles. There is never a camping-ground of Mève's
army on their march a century B.C. from Rathcroghan in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Roscommon to the plain of Mochruime in Louth, and never
a skirmish fought by them that has not given its name to some
plain or camping-ground or ford. Passing from the heroes of
the Red Branch to the history of Finn mac Cool and the
Fenians, we find the same thing. Finn's seat, the Hill of the
Fenians, Diarmuid and Gráinne's bed, and many other names
derived from them or incidents connected with them, are
equally widely scattered.</p>

<p>The question now arises, does the undoubted existence of
these place-names, many of them mentioned in the very oldest
manuscripts we have&mdash;these manuscripts being only copies of
still more ancient ones now lost&mdash;mentioned, too, in connection
with the celebrated events which are there said to have
given them their names, do these and the universally received
genealogies of historic tribes which trace themselves back to
some ancestor who figured at the time when these place-names
were imposed, form credible witnesses to their substantial
truth? In other words, are such names as Creeveroe<a name="FNanchor_1_100" id="FNanchor_1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_100" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (Red
Branch) given to the spot where the Red Branch heroes have
been always represented as residing; or Ardee (Ferdia's Ford)
where Cuchulain fought his great single fight with that
champion&mdash;are these to be accepted as collateral evidence of the
Red Branch heroes of Ferdia and of Cuchulain? Are See-finn
(Finn's seat) or Rath Coole<a name="FNanchor_2_101" id="FNanchor_2_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_101" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (Cool's rath) to be
accepted as proving the existence of Finn and his father
Cool?</p>

<p>In my opinion no stress, or very little, can be laid upon the
argument from topography, which weighed so heavily with
Keating, O'Donovan, and O'Curry, for if it is admitted at all it
proves too much. If it proves the objective existence of Finn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and of Cuchulain, so does it that of Dana, "the mother of the
gods," and of divinities by the score. Besides the Gaels brought
their topographical nomenclature with them to Alba, and
places named from Finn and the Fenians, are nearly as plentiful
there as in Ireland. Wherever the early Gaels went they took
with them their heroic legends, and wherever they settled place-names
relating to their legends which were so much a part of
their intellectual life, grew up round them too. Something of
the same kind may be seen in Greece&mdash;a land which presents
so many and so striking analogies to that of the Gael; for
wherever a Grecian colony settled, east or west, it was full of
memorials of the legendary past, and Jasonia, or temples of
Jason, and other memorials of the voyage of the Argonauts, are
to be found from Abdêra to Thrace, eastward along the coast
of the Euxine and in the heart of Armenia and Media, just as
memorials of the flight of Diarmuid and of Gráinne from
before Finn mac Cool may be found wherever the Gael are
settled in Ireland, in Scotland, or the Isles.</p>

<p>Having come to the conclusion that Irish topography is
useless for proving the genuineness of past history, let us look
at Irish genealogy. When the Mac Carthys, descendants of
Mac Carthy Mór, trace themselves through Oilioll Olum, king
of Ireland in the second century, to Eber Finn, son of Milesius;
when the O'Briens of Thomond trace themselves to the same
through Oilioll Olum's second son; when the O'Carrolls of Ely
trace themselves to the same through Cian, the third son; when
the O'Neills trace themselves back through Niall of the Nine
Hostages, and Conn of the Hundred Battles to Eremon, son of
Milesius; when the O'Driscolls trace themselves to Ith, who
was uncle of Milesius; when the Magennises trace themselves
through Conall Cearnach, the Red Branch hero, back to Ir,
the son of Milesius; and when every sept and name and family
and clan in Ireland fit in, and even in our oldest manuscripts
have always fitted in, each in its own place, with universally
mutual acknowledgment and unanimity, each man carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
counting his ancestors through their hundredfold ramifications,
and tracing them back first to him from whom they get their
surname, and next to him from whom they get their tribe
name, and from thence to the founder of their house, who in
his turn grafts on to one of the great stems (Eremonian, Eberian,
Irian, or Ithian)<a name="FNanchor_3_102" id="FNanchor_3_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_102" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; and when not only political friendships and
alliances, but the very holding of tribal lands, depended upon
the strict registration and observance of these things&mdash;we ask
again do such facts throw any light upon the credibility of
early Irish history and early Irish records?</p>

<p>The whole intricate system of Irish genealogy, jealously
preserved from the very first, as all Irish literature goes to
show,<a name="FNanchor_4_103" id="FNanchor_4_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_103" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> played so important a part in Irish national history and
in Irish social life, and is at the same time so intimately bound
up with the people's traditions and literature, and throws so
much light upon the past, that it will be well to try to get a
grip of this curious and intricate subject, so important for all
who would attempt to arrive at any knowledge of the life and
feelings of the Irish and Scottish Gael, and upon which so
much formerly depended in the history and alliances of both
races.</p>

<p>All Milesian families trace themselves, as I have said, to one or
other of the three sons of Milesius, who were Eremon, Eber, and
Ir, or to his uncle Ith, who landed in Ireland at any time between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
1700 and 800 years before Christ according to Irish computation.<a name="FNanchor_5_104" id="FNanchor_5_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_104" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
But while they all trace themselves back to this point,
it is to be observed that long before they reach it, in each of
the four branches, some place in the long row of ancestors is
arrived at, some name occurs, in which all or most of the
various genealogies meet, and upon which all the branch lines
converge. Thus in the Eberian families it is found that they
all spring from the three sons of Oilioll [Ul-yul] Olum, who
according to all the annals lived in the second century&mdash;in this
Oilioll all the Eberian families converge.</p>

<p>Again all, or nearly all, the Irians trace themselves to either
Conall Cearnach or Fergus Mac Roy, the great Red Branch
champions who lived in the North shortly before the birth of
Christ.</p>

<p>The tribes of the Ithians, the least numerous and least important
of the four, seem to meet in Mac Con, king of Ireland,
who lived in the second century, and who is the hero of the
saga called the Battle of Moy Mochruime, where Art, son of
Conn of the Hundred Battles, was slain.</p>

<p>In the line of Eremon only, the greatest of the four, do we
find two pedigrees which meet at points <i>considerably antecedent</i>
to the birth of Christ, for the Dál Riada of Scotland join the
same stem as the O'Neills as much as 390 years before Christ,
and the O'Cavanaghs at a still more remote period, in the reign
of Ugony Mór. But setting aside these two families we find
that all the other great reigning houses, as the Mac Donnells of
Antrim, Maguires of Fermanagh, O'Kellys of Connacht, and
others, either meet in the third century in Cairbré of the Liffey,
son of King Cormac mac Art, and grandson of Conn of the
Hundred Battles; or else like the O'Neills of Tyrone,
O'Donnells of Tirconnell, O'Dogherties of Inishowen,
O'Conors of Connacht, O'Flaherties of Galway, they meet in
a still later progenitor&mdash;the father of Niall of the Nine
Hostages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be best to examine here some typical Irish pedigree
that we may more readily understand the system in its simplest
form, and see how families branch from clans, and clans from
stems. Let us take, then, the first pedigree of those given at
the end of the Forus Feasa, that of Mac Carthy Mór, and
study it as a type.</p>

<p>This pedigree begins with Donal, who was the first of the
Mac Carthys to be created Earl of Clancare, or Clancarthy, in
1565. Starting from him the names of all his ancestors are
traced back to Eber, son of Milesius. Passing over his five
immediate ancestors, we come to the sixth. It was he who
built the monastery of Irriallach on the Lake of Killarney.
The seventh ancestor was Donal, from whose brother Donagh
come the families of Ard Canachta and Croc Ornachta. The
tenth was Donal Roe, from whom come the Clan Donal Roe,
and from whose brother, Dermot of Tralee, come the family
of Mac Finneens. The eleventh was Cormac Finn, from
whom come also the Mac Carthys of Duhallow and the kings
of Desmond; while from his brother Donal come the Mac
Carthys Riabhach, or Grey Mac Carthys. The thirteenth was
Dermot of Kill Baghani, from whom come the Clan Teig Roe
na Sgarti. The fourteenth was Cormac of Moy Tamhnaigh,
from whose brother Teig come the Mac Auliffes of Cork.
The fifteenth was Muireadach, who was the first of the line to
assume the surname of Mac Carthy, which he did from his father
Carthach, from whom all the Síol Carthaigh [Sheeol Caurhy],
or Seed of Carthach, including the Mac Fineens, Mac Auliffes,
etc., are descended. The seventeenth was Saerbhrethach, from
whose brother Murrough spring the sept of the O'Callaghans.
The nineteenth was Callaghan of Cashel, king of Munster, celebrated
in Irish romance for his warfare with the Danes. The
twenty-third was Snedgus, who had a brother named Fogartach,
from whose son Finguini sprang the Muinntir Finguini, or
Finguini's People. The twenty-eighth was Falbi Flann, who
was king of Munster from 622 to 633, from whose brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Finghin sprang the sept of the O'Sullivans. The thirty-second
was Angus, from one son of whom Eochaidh [Yohy] Finn are
descended the O'Keefes; while from another son Enna, spring
the O'Dalys of Munster&mdash;he was the first king of Munster
who became a Christian, and he was slain in 484. The thirty-fourth
was Arc, king of Munster, from whose son Cas, spring
the following septs: The O'Donoghue Mór&mdash;from whom
branched off the O'Donoghue of the Glen&mdash;O'Mahony Finn
and O'Mahony Roe, <i>i.e.</i>, the White and Red O'Mahonys, and
O'Mahony of Ui Floinn Laei, and O'Mahony of Carbery, also
O'Mullane<a name="FNanchor_6_105" id="FNanchor_6_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_105" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and O'Cronin; while from his other son, "Cairbré
the Pict," sprang the O'Moriarties, and from Cairbré's grandson
came the O'Garvans. The thirty-sixth ancestor was Olild
Flann Beg, king of Munster, who had a son from whom are
descended the sept of O'Donovan, and the O'Coiléains, or
Collinses. And a grandson from whom spring the O'Meehans,
O'Hehirs, and the Mac Davids of Thomond. The thirty-seventh,
Fiachaidh, was well known in Irish romance; the
thirty-eighth was Eoghan, or Owen Mór, from whom all the
septs of the Eoghanachts, or Eugenians of Munster come, who
embrace every family and sept hitherto mentioned, and many
more. They are carefully to be distinguished from the Dalcassians,
who are descended from Owen's second son Cas. It
was the Dalcassians who, with Brian Boru at their head, preserved
Ireland from the Danes and won Clontarf. For many
centuries the history of Munster is largely composed of the
struggles between these two septs for the kingship. The thirty-ninth
is the celebrated Oilioll [Ulyul] Olum, king of Munster,
whose wail of grief over his son Owen is a stock piece in
Irish MSS. He is a son of the great Owen, better known as
Mogh Nuadhat, or Owen the Splendid, who wrested half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
kingdom from Conn of the Hundred Battles, so that to this
very day Connacht and Ulster together are called in Irish
Conn's Half, and Munster and Leinster Owen's Half. The
forty-third ancestor is Dergthini, who is known in Irish history
as one of the three heirs of the royal houses in Ireland, whom
I have mentioned before as having been saved from massacre
when the Free Clans or Nobility were cut to pieces by the
Unfree or Rent-paying tribes at Moy Cro&mdash;an event which is
nearly contemporaneous with the birth of Christ. Hitherto
there have been nine kings of Munster in this line, but not a
single king of Ireland, but the forty-ninth ancestor, Duach
Dalta Degadh, also called Duach Donn, attains this high
honour, and takes his place among the Reges Hiberniæ about
172 years before Christ, according to the "Four Masters." After
this a rather bald catalogue of thirty-six more ancestors are
reckoned, no fewer than twenty-four being counted among the
kings of Ireland, and at last, at the eighty-sixth ancestor from
the Earl of Clancarthy, the genealogy finds its long-delayed
goal in Eber, son of Milesius.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this typical pedigree of the Mac Carthys&mdash;any
other great family would have answered our purpose just
as well&mdash;how families spring from clans and clans from septs&mdash;to
use an English word&mdash;and septs from a common stem; and how
the nearness or remoteness of some common ancestor bound a
number of clans in nearer or remoter alliance to one another.
Thus all septs of the great Eberian stem had some slight and
faint tie of common ancestry connecting them, which comes
out most strongly in their jealousy of the Eremonian or northern
stem, but was not sufficient to produce a political alliance
amongst themselves. Of a much stronger nature was the tie
which bound those families descended from Eoghan Mór, the
thirty-eighth ancestor from the first earl. These went under the
name of the Eoghanachts, and held fairly together, always
opposing the Dalcassians, descended from Cas. But when it
came to the adoption of a surname, as it did in the eleventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
century, those who descended from the ancestor who gave them
their name, were bound to one another by the common ties or
a nearer kinship and a common surname.</p>

<p>It will be seen at a glance from the above pedigree, how,
taking the Mac Carthys as a stem, and starting from the first
earl, the Mac Finneens join that stem at the eleventh ancestor
from the earl, the Mac Auliffes at the fifteenth, the O'Callaghans
at the eighteenth, the O'Sullivans at the twenty-ninth,
the O'Keefes at the thirty-second, the O'Dalys<a name="FNanchor_7_106" id="FNanchor_7_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_106" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of Munster
at the thirty-second, the O'Donoghues, O'Mahonys,
O'Mullanes, O'Cronins, O'Garvans, and Moriartys at the
thirty-fourth, the O'Donovans, Collinses, O'Meehans,
O'Hehirs, and Mac Davids at the thirty-sixth.</p>

<p>Now each of these had his own genealogy equally carefully
kept by his own ancestral bardic historian. If, for instance,
the Mac Carthys could boast of nine kings of Munster amongst
them, the O'Keefes could boast of ten; and an O'Keefe
reckoning from Donal Óg, who was slain at the battle of
Aughrim, would say that the Mac Carthys joined <i>his</i> line at
the thirty-sixth ancestor from Donal.</p>

<p>All the Gaels of Ireland of the free tribes trace back their
ancestry, as we have seen, to one or other of the four great
stocks of Erimon, Eber, Ir, and Ith. Of these the EREMONIANS
were by far the greatest, the EBERIANS coming next.
The O'Neills, O'Donnells, O'Conors, O'Cavanaghs, and
almost all the leading families of the north, the west, and the
east were Erimonian; the O'Briens, Mac Carthys, and most
of the leading tribes of the south were Eberians.<a name="FNanchor_8_107" id="FNanchor_8_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_107" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
nearly always a member of one or the other of these two stems
who held the high-kingship of Ireland, but so much more
powerful were the Eremonians within historical times, that the
Southern Eberians, although well able to maintain themselves
in the south, yet found themselves absolutely unable to place
more than one or two<a name="FNanchor_9_108" id="FNanchor_9_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_108" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> high-kings upon the throne of All-Ireland,
from the coming of Patrick, until the great Brian Boru
once more broke the spell and wrested the monarchy from the
Erimonians. The Irians gave few kings to Ireland, and the
Ithians still less&mdash;only three or four, and these in very early,
perhaps mythic, times.</p>

<p>If now we trace the O'Neill pedigree back as we did that of
the Mac Carthys, we find the great Shane O'Neill who fought
Elizabeth, traced back step by step to the perfectly historical
character Niall of the Nine Hostages, son of Eochaidh
Muigh-mheadhoin [Mwee-va-on], who was grandson of
Fiachaidh Sreabhtine [Sravtinna], son of Cairbré of the Liffey,
son of the great Cormac Mac Art, and grandson or Conn of the
Hundred Battles, all of whom are celebrated in history and endless
romance; and thence through a list containing in all forty-four
High-kings of Ireland back to EREMON, son of Milesius,
brother of that Eber from whom the Mac Carthys spring, and
from whom he is the eighty-eighth in descent. The O'Donnells
join his line at the thirty-sixth ancestor, the O'Gallaghers at
the thirty-second, the O'Conor Don and O'Conor Roe and the
O'Flaherty at the thirty-seventh. We find too, on examining
these pedigrees, the most curious inter-mixtures and crossing
of families. Thus, for instance, the two families of O'Crowley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
in Munster spring from the Mac Dermot Roe of Connacht,
who, with the Mac Donogh, sprang from Mac Dermot of
Moylurg in Roscommon, ancestor of the prince of Coolavin;
while the O'Gara, former lord of Coolavin in the same county,
to whom the "Four Masters" dedicated their annals, was of
southern Eberian stock.</p>

<p>The great warriors of the Red Branch, the men of the
original kingdom of Uladh [Ulla, <i>i.e.</i>, Ulster], were of the
third great stock, the IRIANS or race of Ir,<a name="FNanchor_10_109" id="FNanchor_10_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_109" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> but they are
perhaps better known as the Clanna Rudhraighe [Rury] or
Rudricians, so named from Rudhraighe, a great monarch of
Ireland who lived nearly three hundred years before Christ, or
as Ulidians because they represented the ancient province of
Uladh. But the Three Collas, grandsons of Cairbré of the
Liffey, who was himself great-grandson of Conn of the Hundred
Battles, and of course of the Eremonian stock, overthrew the
Irians in the year 332, and burned their capital, Emania. The
Irians were thus driven out by the Eremonians, and forced back
into the present counties of Down and Antrim, where they
continued to maintain their independence. So bitterly, however,
did they resent the treatment they had received at the
hands of the Eremonians, and so deeply did the burning of
Emania continue to rankle in their hearts, that after a period of
nearly 900 years they are said to have stood sullenly aloof from
the other Irish, and to have refused to make common cause
with them against the Normans at the battle of Downpatrick
in 1260, where the prince of the O'Neills was slain.<a name="FNanchor_11_110" id="FNanchor_11_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_110" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> So
powerful, on the other hand, did the idea of race-connection
remain, that we find one of the bards so late as the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
century urging a political combination and alliance between
the descendants of the Three Collas who had burned Emania
over twelve hundred years before, and who were then represented
by the Maguires of Fermanagh, the Mac Mahons of
Oriel<a name="FNanchor_12_111" id="FNanchor_12_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_111" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and the far-off O'Kellys of Ui Máine<a name="FNanchor_13_112" id="FNanchor_13_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_112" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> [Ee maana].</p>

<p>As for the fourth great stock, the ITHIANS,<a name="FNanchor_14_113" id="FNanchor_14_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_113" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> they were
gradually pushed aside by the Eberians of the south, as the
Irians had been by the Eremonians of the north, and driven
into the islands and coasts of West Munster. Yet curiously
enough the northern Dukes of Argyle and the Campbells and
MacAllans of Scotland spring from them. Their chief tribes
in Ireland were known as the Corca Laidhi [Corka-lee]; these
were the pirate O'Driscolls and their correlatives, but they
were pushed so hard by the Mac Carthys, O'Mahonys, and
other Eberians, that in the year 1615 their territory was confined
to a few parishes, and twenty years later even these are
found paying tribute to the Mac Carthy Reagh. There is one
very remarkable peculiarity about their genealogies, which is,
that, though they trace themselves with great apparent, and no
doubt real, accuracy back to Mac Con, monarch of Ireland and
contemporary with Oilioll Olum in the end of the second
century, yet from that point back to Milesius a great number
of generations (some twenty or so) are missing, and no genealogist,
so far as I know, in any of the books of pedigrees which
I have consulted, has attempted to supply them by filling them
up with a barren list of names, as has been done in the other
three stems.<a name="FNanchor_15_114" id="FNanchor_15_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_114" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now consider how far these genealogies tend to
establish the authenticity of our early history, saga, and literature.
The first plain and obvious objection to them is this&mdash;that
genealogies which trace themselves back to Adam must
be untrue inventions.</p>

<p>We grant it.</p>

<p>But all Gaelic genealogies meet, as we have shown in
Milesius or his uncle, Ith. Strike off all that long tale or
pre-Milesian names connecting him with Adam, and count
them as a late excrescence&mdash;a mixture of pagan myth and
Christian invention added to the rest for show. This leaves
us only the four stems to deal with.</p>

<p>The next objection is that pedigrees which trace themselves
back to the landing of the Milesians&mdash;a date in the computation
of which Irish annalists themselves differ by a few hundred
years&mdash;must also be untrue, especially as their own annalist,
Tighearnach, has expressly said that all their history prior
to about 300 B.C. is uncertain.</p>

<p>We grant this also.</p>

<p>What, then, remains?</p>

<p>This remains&mdash;namely the points in each of the four great
race stems, in which all or the most of the leading tribes and
families belonging to that stem converge, and, as we have seen,
all of these with a few exceptions take place within reach of
the historical period. In the lines of EBER and of ITH, this
point is at the close of the second century; in the race of IR
it is about the time of Christ's birth,<a name="FNanchor_16_115" id="FNanchor_16_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_115" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and in the fourth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
perhaps most important stem, that of EREMON, the two main
points of convergence are in the historical Niall of the Nine
Hostages, who came to the throne in 356, and in Cairbré of
the Liffey, who became High-king in 267.<a name="FNanchor_17_116" id="FNanchor_17_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_116" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

Erimonian descent, but settled in the south. They were quite conquered

included, see p. 223 of O'Clery's MS. Keating's pedigree, as given in
the body of his history, gives twenty-three generations also, but only
seventeen in the special genealogy attached to it. There are no such
curious discrepancies in the other three stems. I can only account for it
by the impoverished and oppressed condition of the Ithians, which in later

entry at the year 432, "a morte Concculaind herois usque ad hunc annum
431, a morte Concupair [Conor] mic Nessa 412 anni sunt." It is worth
noting that none of the Gaelic families trace their pedigree, so far as I
know, to either Cuchulain himself, or to his over-lord, King Conor mac
Nessa. Cuchulain was himself not of Ithian but of Eremonian blood,
although so closely connected with Emania, the Red Branch, and the
Clanna Rury. If Irish pedigrees had been like modern ones for sale, or
could in any way have been tampered with, every one would have preferred
Cuchulain for an ancestor. That no one has got him is a strong
presumption in favour of the genuineness of Irish genealogies.</p></div>

<h4>DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</h4>


<p>We must now consider whether Irish genealogies were really
traced or not to those points which I have mentioned. Is
there any documentary evidence in support of such an assertion?</p>

<p>There is certainly some such evidence, and we shall proceed
to examine it.</p>

<p>In the Leabhar na h-Uidhre [Lowar na Heera], or Book of
the Dun Cow, the existing manuscript of which was transcribed
about the year 1100, in the Book of Leinster, transcribed
about fifty years later, in the Book of Ballymote and in the
Book of Lecan, frequent reference is made to an ancient book
now lost called the Cin or Codex of Drom-sneachta. This
book, or a copy of it, existed down to the beginning of the
seventeenth century, for Keating quotes from it in his history,
and remarks at the same time, "and it was before the coming
of Patrick to Ireland the author of that book existed."<a name="FNanchor_1_117" id="FNanchor_1_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_117" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This
evidence of Keating might be brushed aside as an exaggeration
did it stand alone, but it does not, for in a partially effaced
memorandum in the Book of Leinster, transcribed from older
books about the year 1150, we read: "[Ernin, son of]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Duach,<a name="FNanchor_2_118" id="FNanchor_2_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_118" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> son of the king of Connacht, an ollav and a
prophet and a professor in history and a professor in wisdom;
it was he that collected the genealogies and histories of the
men of Erin into one, and that is the Cin Droma-sneachta."
Now there were only two Duachs according to our annals,
one of these was great-grandson of Niall of the Nine Hostages,
and of course a pagan, who died in 379; the other, who was
an ancestor of the O'Flaherties, died one hundred and twenty
years later. It was Duach the pagan, whose second son was
Ernin; the other had only one son, whose name was Senach.
If O'Curry has read the half-effaced word correctly, then the
book may have been, as Keating says it was, written before
St. Patrick's coming, and it contained, as the various references
to it show, a <i>repertoire</i> of genealogies collected by the son of a
man who died in 379; this man, too, being great-grandson of
that Niall of the Nine Hostages in whose son so large a
number of the Eremonian genealogies converge.<a name="FNanchor_3_119" id="FNanchor_3_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_119" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>There are many considerations which lead me to believe
that Irish genealogical books were kept from the earliest introduction
of the art of writing, and kept with greater accuracy,
perhaps, than any other records of the past whatsoever. The
chiefest of these is the well-known fact that, under the tribal
system, no one possessed lawfully any portion of the soil inhabited
by his tribe if he were not of the same race with his
chief. Consequently even those of lowest rank in the tribe
traced and recorded their pedigree with as much care as did
the highest, for "it was from his own genealogy each man of
the tribe, poor as well as rich, held the charter of his civil
state, his right of property in the cantred in which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
born."<a name="FNanchor_4_120" id="FNanchor_4_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_120" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> All these genealogies were entered in the local books
of each tribe and were preserved in the verses of the hereditary
poets. There was no incentive to action among the early
Irish so stimulative as a remembrance of their pedigree. It
was the same among the Welsh, and probably among all tribes
of Celtic blood. We find the witty but unscrupulous Giraldus,
in the twelfth century, saying of his Welsh countrymen that
every one of them, even of the common people, observes the
genealogy of his race, and not only knows by heart his grandfathers
and great-grandfathers, but knows all his ancestors
up to the sixth or seventh generation,<a name="FNanchor_5_121" id="FNanchor_5_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_121" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or even still further,
and promptly repeats his genealogy as Rhys, son of Griffith,
son of Rhys, son of Teudor, etc.<a name="FNanchor_6_122" id="FNanchor_6_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_122" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The poet, Cuan O'Lochain, who died in the year 1024,
gives a long account of the Saltair of Tara now lost, the compilation
of which he ascribes to Cormac mac Art, who came
to the throne in 227,<a name="FNanchor_7_123" id="FNanchor_7_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_123" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and in which he says the synchronisms
and chronology of all the kings were written. The Book of
Ballymote too quotes from an ancient book, now lost, called
the Book of the Uachongbhail, to the effect that "the synchronisms
and genealogies and succession of their kings and
monarchs, their battles, their contests, and their antiquities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
from the world's beginning down to that time were written in
it, and this is the Saltair of Tara, which is the origin and
fountain of the historians of Erin from that period down to
this time." This may not be convincing proof that Cormac
mac Art wrote the Saltair, but it is convincing proof that
what were counted as the very earliest books were filled with
genealogies.</p>

<p>The subject of tribal genealogy upon which the whole
social fabric depended was far too important to be left without
a check in the hands of tribal historians, however well-intentioned.
And this check was afforded by the great
convention or Féis, which took place triennially at Tara,<a name="FNanchor_8_124" id="FNanchor_8_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_124" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
whither the historians had to bring their books that under
the scrutiny of the jealous eyes of rivals they might be purged
of whatever could not be substantiated, "and neither law nor
usage nor historic record was ever held as genuine until it had
received such approval, and nothing that disagreed with the
Roll of Tara could be respected as truth."<a name="FNanchor_9_125" id="FNanchor_9_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_125" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"It was," says Duald Mac Firbis<a name="FNanchor_10_126" id="FNanchor_10_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_126" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>&mdash;himself the author of
probably the greatest book of genealogies ever written, speaking
about the chief tribal historians of Ireland, "obligatory on
every one of them who followed it to purify the profession";
and he adds very significantly, "Along with these [historians]
the judges of Banba [Ireland] used to be in like manner preserving
the history, <i>for a man could not be a judge without being
a historian</i>, and he is not a historian who is not a judge in the
BRETHADH NIMHEDH,<a name="FNanchor_11_127" id="FNanchor_11_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_127" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that is the last book in the study of
the Shanachies and of the judges themselves."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>The poets and historians "were obliged to be free from
theft, and killing, and satirising, and adultery, and everything
that would be a reproach to their learning." Mac Firbis, who
was the last working historian of a great professional family,
puts the matter nobly and well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Any Shanachie," he says, "whether an ollav or the next in rank,
or belonging to the order at all, who did not preserve these rules,
lost half his income and his dignity according to law, and was
subject to heavy penalties besides, so that it is not to be supposed
that there is in the world a person who would not prefer to tell the
truth, if he had no other reason than the fear of God and the loss of
his dignity and his income: and it is not becoming to charge
partiality upon these elected historians [of the nation]. However, if
unworthy people did write falsehood, and attributed it to a historian,
it might become a reproach to the order of historians if they were
not on their guard, and did not look to see whether it was out of
their prime books of authority that those writers obtained their
knowledge. And that is what should be done by every one, both by
the lay scholar and the professional historian&mdash;everything of which
they have a suspicion, to look for it, and if they do not find it confirmed
in good books, to note down its doubtfulness,<a name="FNanchor_12_128" id="FNanchor_12_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_128" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> along with it,
as I myself do to certain races hereafter in this book, and it is thus
that the historians are freed from the errors of others, should these
errors be attributed to <i>them</i>, which God forbid."</p></blockquote>

<p>I consider it next to impossible for any Gaelic pedigree to
have been materially tampered with from the introduction of
the art of writing, because tribal jealousies alone would have
prevented it, and because each stem of the four races was
connected at some point with every other stem, the whole
clan system being inextricably intertwined, and it was necessary
for all the various tribal genealogies to agree, in order that
each branch, sub-branch, and family might fit, each in its own
place.</p>

<p>I have little doubt that the genealogy of O'Neill, for
instance, which traces him back to the father of Niall of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Nine Hostages who came to the throne in 356 is substantially
correct. Niall, it must be remembered, was father of Laoghaire
[Leary], who was king when St. Patrick arrived, by
which time, if not before, the art of writing was known in
Ireland. <i>À fortiori</i>, then, we may trust the pedigrees of the
O'Donnells and the rest who join that stem a little later on.</p>

<p>If this be acknowledged we may make a cautious step or two
backwards. No one, so far as I know, has much hesitation in
acknowledging the historic character of that King Laoghaire
whom St. Patrick confronted, nor of his father Niall of the
Nine Hostages. But if we go so far, it wants very little to
bring us in among the Fenians themselves, and the scenes connected
with them and with Conn of the Hundred Battles; for
Niall's great-grandfather was that Fiachaidh who was slain
by the Three Collas&mdash;those who burnt Emania and destroyed
the Red Branch&mdash;and his father is Cairbré of the Liffey, who
overthrew the Fenians, and his father again is the great Cormac
son of Art, son of Conn of the Hundred Battles who divided
the kingdom with Owen Mór. But it is from the three
grandsons of this Owen Mór the Eberians come, and from
their half-brother come the Ithians, so that up to this point
I think Irish genealogies may be in the main accepted. Even
the O'Kavanaghs and their other correlations, who do not join
the stem of Eremon till between 500 or 600 years before
Christ, yet pass through Enna Cennsalach, king of Leinster,
a perfectly historical character mentioned several times in the
Book of Armagh,<a name="FNanchor_13_129" id="FNanchor_13_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_129" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who slew the father of Niall of the Nine
Hostages; and I believe that, however we may account for the
strange fact that these septs join the Eremonian stem so many
hundreds of years before the O'Neills and the others, that up
to this point their genealogy too may be trusted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>If this is the case, and if it is true that every Gael belonging
to the Free Clans of Ireland could trace his pedigree with
accuracy back to the fourth, third, or even second century, it
affords a strong support to Irish history, and in my opinion
considerably heightens the credibility of our early annals, and
renders the probability that Finn mac Cool and the Red
Branch heroes were real flesh and blood, enormously greater
than before. It will also put us on our guard against quite
accepting such sweeping generalisations as those of Skene,
when he says that the entire legendary history of Ireland
prior to the establishment of Christianity in the fifth century
partakes largely of a purely artificial character. We must not
forget that while no Irish genealogy is traced to the De Danann
tribes, who were undoubtedly gods, yet the ancestor of the
Dalcassians&mdash;Cormac Cas, Oilioll Olum's son&mdash;is said to have
married Ossian's daughter.</p>

<h4>CONFUSION BETWEEN GODS AND MEN</h4>


<p>Of that part of every Irish pedigree which runs back from the
first century to Milesius nothing can be laid down with
certainty, nor indeed can there be any <i>absolute certainty</i> in
affirming that Irish pedigrees from the eleventh to the third
century are reliable&mdash;we have only an amount of cumulative
evidence from which we may draw such a deduction with
considerable confidence. The mere fact that these pedigrees
are traced back a thousand years further through Irish kings
and heroes, and end in a son of Milesius, need not in the
least affect&mdash;as in popular estimation it too often does&mdash;the
credibility of the last seventeen hundred years, which stands
upon its own merits.</p>

<p>On the contrary, such a continuation is just what we should
expect. In the Irish genealogies the sons of Milesius occupy
the place that in other early genealogies is held by the gods.
And the sons of Milesius were possibly the tutelary gods of
the Gael. We have seen how one of them was so, at least
in folk belief, and was addressed in semi-seriousness as still
living and reigning even in the last century.</p>

<p>All the Germanic races looked upon themselves as descended
from gods. The Saxon, Anglian, Danish, Norwegian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Swedish kings were traced back either to Woden or to some
of his companions or sons.<a name="FNanchor_1_130" id="FNanchor_1_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_130" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It was the same with the Greeks,
to whom the Celts bear so close a similitude. Their Herakleids,
Asklepiads, Æakids, Neleids, and Daedalids, are a close
counterpart to our Eremonians, Eberians, Ithians, and Irians,
and in each case all the importance was attached to the
primitive eponymous hero or god from whom they sprang.
Without him the whole pedigree became uninteresting, unfinished,
headless. These beliefs exercised full power even
upon the ablest and most cultured Greeks. Aristotle and
Hippocratês, for instance, considered themselves descended from
Asklêpius, Thucidydes from Æakus, and Socrates from
Daedalus; just as O'Neill and O'Donnell did from Eremon,
O'Brien from Eber, and Magennis from Ir. It was to the
divine or heroic fountain heads of the race, not so much as to
the long and mostly barren list of names which led up to it,
that the real importance was attached. It is not in Ireland
alone that we see mythology condensing into a dated
genealogy. The same thing has happened in Persian history,
and the history of Denmark by Saxo Grammaticus affords
many such instances. In Greece the Neleid family of Pylus
traced their origin to Neptune, the Lacedæmonian kings traced
theirs to Cadmus and Danaüs, and Hekatæus of Miletus was
the fifteenth descendant of a god.</p>

<p>Again we meet with in Teutonic and Hellenic mythology
the same difficulty that meets us in our own&mdash;that of distinguishing
gods from heroes and heroes from men. The legends
of the Dagda and of Angus of the Boyne and the Tuatha
De Danann, of Tighearnmas and the Fomorians, of Lugh the
Long-handed and the children of Tuireann&mdash;all evidently
mythologic&mdash;were treated in the same manner, recited by the
same tongues, and regarded with the same unwavering belief,
as the history of Conor mac Nessa and Déirdre, of Cuchulain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and Mève, or that of Conn of the Hundred Battles, Owen
Mór, Finn mac Cool, and the Fenians. The early Greek,
in the same way, treated the stories of Apollo and Artemis, of
Arês and Aphroditê, just as he did those of Diomede and
Helen, Meleager and Althæa, Achilles, or the voyage of the
<i>Argo</i>. All were in a primitive and uncritical age received
with the same unsuspicious credulity, and there was no hard-and-fast
line drawn between gods and men. Just as the Mórrígan,
the war-goddess, has her eye dashed out by Cuchulain,
so do we find in Homer gods wounded by heroes. Thus, too,
Apollo is condemned to serve Admetus, and Hercules is sold
as a slave to Omphalê. Herodotus himself confesses that he
is unable to determine whether a certain Thracian god
Zalmoxis, was a god or a man,<a name="FNanchor_2_131" id="FNanchor_2_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_131" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and he finds the same difficulty
regarding Dionysus and Pan; while Plutarch refuses to determine
whether Janus was a god or a king;<a name="FNanchor_3_132" id="FNanchor_3_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_132" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Herakleitus
the philosopher, confronted by the same difficulty, made the
admirable <i>mot</i> that men were "mortal gods," gods were "immortal
men."<a name="FNanchor_4_133" id="FNanchor_4_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_133" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In our literature, although the fact does not always appear
distinctly, the Dagda, Angus Óg, Lugh the Long-handed,
Ogma, and their fellows are the equivalents of the immortal
gods, while certainly Cuchulain and Conor and probably
Curigh Mac Daire, Conall Cearnach, and the other famous
Red Branch chiefs, whatever they may have been in reality,
are the equivalent of the Homeric heroes, that is to say,
believed to have been epigoni of the gods, and therefore greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
than ordinary human beings; while just as in Greek story
there are the cycles of the war round Thebes, the voyage of
the <i>Argo</i> the fate of &#338;dipus, etc., so we have in Irish
numerous smaller groups of epic stories&mdash;now unfortunately
mostly lost or preserved in digests&mdash;which, leaving out the
Cuchulain and Fenian cycles, centre round such minor characters
as Macha, who founded Emania, Leary Lore, Labhraidh
[Lowry] the Mariner, and others.</p>

<p>That the Irish gods die in both saga and annals like so many
human beings, in no wise militates against the supposition of
their godhead. Even the Greek did not always consider his gods
as eternal. A study of comparative mythology teaches that gods
are in their original essence magnified men, and subject to all
men's changes and chances. They are begotten and born
like men. They eat, sleep, feel sickness, sorrow, pain, like
men. "Like men," says Grimm, "they speak a language,
feel passions, transact affairs, are clothed and armed, possess
dwellings and utensils." Being man-like in these things, they
are also man-like in their deaths. They are only on a greater
scale than we. "This appears to me," says Grimm,<a name="FNanchor_5_134" id="FNanchor_5_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_134" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "a
fundamental feature in the faith of the heathen, that they
allowed to their gods not an unlimited and unconditional
duration, but only a term of life far exceeding that of man."
As their shape is like the shape of man only vaster, so are
their lives like the lives of men only indefinitely longer. "With
our ancestors [the Teutons]," said Grimm, "the thought of
the gods being immortal retires into the background. The
Edda never calls them 'eylifir' or 'ôdauðligir,' and their
death is spoken of without disguise." So is it with us also.
The Dagda dies, slain in the battle of North Moytura; the
three "gods of the De Danann" die at the instigation of
Lugh; and the great Lugh himself, from whom Lugdunum,
now Lyons, takes its name, and to whom early Celtic
inscriptions are found, shares the same fate. Manannán is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
slain, so is Ogma, and so are many more. And yet though
recorded as slain they do not wholly disappear. Manannán
came back to Bran riding in his chariot across the Ocean,<a name="FNanchor_6_135" id="FNanchor_6_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_135" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and Lugh makes his frequent appearances amongst the
living.</p>

It is most curious to find this so
academic question dragged into the hard light of day and subjected to the
scrutiny of so prosaic a person as the Roman tax-collector. Under the
Roman Empire all lands in Greece belonging to the immortal gods were
exempted from tribute, and the Roman tax-collector refused to recognise
as immortal gods any deities who had once been men. The confusion
arising from such questions offered an admirable target to Lucian for his
keenest shafts of ridicule.</p></div>

<h4>DRUIDISM</h4>


<p>Although Irish literature is full of allusions to the druids it
is extremely difficult to know with any exactness what they
were. They are mentioned from the earliest times. The pre-Milesian
races, the Nemedians and Fomorians, had their
druids, who worked mutual spells against each other. The
Tuatha De Danann had innumerable druids amongst them,
who used magic. The invading Milesians had three druids
with them in their ships, Amergin the poet and two others.
In fact, druids are mentioned in connection with all early
Irish fiction and history, from the first colonising of Ireland
down to the time of the saints. It seems very doubtful,
however, whether there existed in Ireland as definitely established
an order of druids as in Britain and on the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_1_136" id="FNanchor_1_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_136" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
They are frequently mentioned in Irish literature as ambassadors,
spokesmen, teachers, and tutors. Kings were sometimes
druids, so were poets. It is a word which seems to me to have
been, perhaps from the first, used with great laxity and great latitude.
The druids, so far as we can ascertain, do not seem to be
connected with any positive rites or worship; still less do they
appear to have been a regular priesthood, and there is not a
shadow of evidence to connect them with any special worship
as that of the sun or of fire. In the oldest saga-cycle the
druid appears as a man of the highest rank and related to
kings. King Conor's father was according to some&mdash;probably
the oldest&mdash;accounts a druid; so was Finn mac Cool's
grandfather.</p>

<p>Before the coming of St. Patrick there certainly existed
images, or, as they are called by the ancient authorities,
"idols" in Ireland, at which or to which sacrifice used to be
offered, probably with a view to propitiating the earth-gods,
possibly the Tuatha De Danann, and securing good harvests
and abundant kine. From sacrificial rites spring, almost of
necessity, a sacrificial caste, and this caste&mdash;the druids&mdash;had
arrived at a high state of organisation in Gaul and Britain
when observed by Cæsar, and did not hesitate to sacrifice whole
hecatombs of human beings. "They think," said Cæsar,
"that unless a man's life is rendered up for a man's life, the
will of the immortal God cannot be satisfied, and they have
sacrifices of this kind as a national institution."</p>

<p>There appears nothing, however, that I am aware of, to
connect the druids in Ireland with human sacrifice, although
such sacrifice appears to have been offered. The druids, however,
appear to have had private idols of their own. We find
a very minute account in the tenth-century glossary of King
Cormac as to how a poet performed incantations with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
idols. The word "poet" is here apparently equivalent to
druid, as the word "druid" like the Latin <i>vates</i> is frequently
a synonym for "poet." Here is how the glossary explains the
incantation called <i>Imbas Forosnai</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This," says the ancient lexicographer, "describes to the poet
whatsoever thing he wishes to discover,<a name="FNanchor_2_137" id="FNanchor_2_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_137" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and this is the manner in
which it is performed. The poet chews a bit of the raw red flesh
of a pig, a dog, or a cat, and then retires with it to his own bed
behind the door,<a name="FNanchor_3_138" id="FNanchor_3_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_138" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> where he pronounces an oration over it and
offers it to his <i>idol gods</i>. He then <i>invokes the idols</i>, and if he has not
received the illumination before the next day, he pronounces incantations
upon his two palms and takes his idol gods unto him [into
his bed] in order that he may not be interrupted in his sleep. He
then places his two hands upon his two cheeks and falls asleep. He
is then watched so that he be not stirred nor interrupted by any one
until everything that he seeks be revealed to him at the end of a
<i>nomad</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_139" id="FNanchor_4_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_139" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> or two or three, or as long as he continues at his offering,
and hence it is that this ceremony is called Imbas, that is, the two
hands upon him crosswise, that is, a hand over and a hand hither
upon his cheeks. And St. Patrick prohibited this ceremony, because
it is a species of Teinm Laeghdha,<a name="FNanchor_5_140" id="FNanchor_5_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_140" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that is, he declared that any one
who performed it should have no place in heaven or on earth."</p></blockquote>

<p>These were apparently the private images of the druid
himself which are spoken of, but there certainly existed public
idols in pagan Ireland before the evangelisation of the island.
St. Patrick himself, in his "Confession," asserts that before his
coming the Irish worshipped idols&mdash;<i>idola et immunda</i>&mdash;and we
have preserved to us more than one account of the great gold-covered
image which was set up in Moy Slaught<a name="FNanchor_6_141" id="FNanchor_6_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_141" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> [<i>i.e.</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Plain of Adoration], believed to be in the present county of
Cavan. It stood there surrounded by twelve lesser idols ornamented
with brass, and may possibly have been regarded as a
sun-god ruling over the twelve seasons. It was called the
Crom Cruach or Cenn Cruach,<a name="FNanchor_7_142" id="FNanchor_7_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_142" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and certain Irish tribes considered
it their special tutelary deity. The Dinnseanchas, or
explanation of the name of Moy Slaught, calls it "the King
Idol of Erin," "and around him were twelve idols made
of stones, but he was of gold. Until Patrick's advent he was
the god of every folk that colonised Ireland. To him they
used to offer the firstlings of every issue and the chief scions
of every clan;" and the ancient poem in the Book of Leinster
declares that it was "a high idol with many fights, which was
named the Cromm Cruaich."<a name="FNanchor_8_143" id="FNanchor_8_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_143" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The poem tells us that "the brave Gaels used to worship it,
and would never ask from it satisfaction as to their portion of
the hard world without paying it tribute."</p>

<p>There is not the slightest reason to distrust this evidence as
far as the existence of Crom Cruach goes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This particular tradition," says Mr. Nutt, "like the majority of
those contained in it [the Dinnseanchas] must be of pre-Christian
origin. It would have been quite impossible for a Christian monk
to have invented such a story, and we may accept it as a perfectly
genuine bit of information respecting the ritual side of insular Celtic
religion."<a name="FNanchor_11_146" id="FNanchor_11_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_146" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>St. Patrick overthrew this idol, according both to the poem
in the Book of Leinster and the early lives of the saint.
The life says that when St. Patrick cursed Crom the ground
opened and swallowed up the twelve lesser idols as far as their
heads, which, as Rhys acutely observes, shows that when the
early Irish lives of the saint were written the pagan sanctuary
had so fallen into decay, that only the heads of the lesser idols
remained above ground, while he thinks that it was at this
time from its bent attitude and decayed appearance the idol
was called Crom, "the Stooper."<a name="FNanchor_12_147" id="FNanchor_12_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_147" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> There is, however, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
apparent or recorded connection between this idol and the
druids, nor do the druids appear to have fulfilled the functions
of a public priesthood in Ireland, and the Introduction to the
Seanchas Mór, or ancient Book of the Brehon Laws, distinctly
says that, "until Patrick came only three classes of persons
were permitted to speak in public in Erin, a chronicler to
relate events and to tell stories, a poet to eulogise and to
satirise, and a Brehon to pass sentence from precedents and
commentaries," thus noticeably omitting all mention of the
druids as a public body.</p>

<p>The idol Crom with his twelve subordinates may very well
have represented the sun, upon whom both season and crops
and consequently the life both of man and beast depend. The
gods to whom the early Irish seem to have sacrificed, were no
doubt, as I think Mr. Nutt has shown, agricultural powers,
the lords of life and growth, and with these the sun, who is at
the root of all growth, was intimately connected, "the object of
that worship was to promote increase, the theory of worship was&mdash;life
for life."<a name="FNanchor_13_148" id="FNanchor_13_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_148" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> That the Irish swore by the sun and the moon
and the elements is certain; the oath is quoted in many places,<a name="FNanchor_14_149" id="FNanchor_14_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_149" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and St. Patrick appears to allude to sun-worship in that passage
of his "Confession," where he says, "that sun which we see
rising daily at His bidding for our sake, it will never reign,
and its splendour will not last for ever, but those who adore it
will perish miserably for all eternity:" this is also borne out
by the passage in Cormac's Glossary of the images the pagans
used to adore, "as, for instance, the form or figure of the sun
on the altar."<a name="FNanchor_15_150" id="FNanchor_15_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_150" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Another phase of the druidic character seems to have been
that he was looked upon as an intermediary between man and
the invisible powers. In the story which tells us how Midir
the De Danann, carries off the king's wife, we are informed
that the druid's counsel is sought as to how to recover her,
which he at last is enabled to do "through his keys of science
and Ogam," after a year's searching.</p>

<p>The druids are represented as carrying wands of yew, but
there is nothing in Irish literature, so far as I am aware of,
about their connection with the oak, from the Greek for
which, <i>&#948;&#961;&#8166;&#962;</i>,<a name="FNanchor_16_151" id="FNanchor_16_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_151" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> they are popularly supposed to derive their
name. They used to be consulted as soothsayers upon the
probable success of expeditions, as by Cormac mac Art, when
he was thinking about extorting a double tribute from
Munster,<a name="FNanchor_17_152" id="FNanchor_17_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_152" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and by Dáthi, the last pagan king of Ireland, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
setting out upon his expedition abroad; they took auguries by
birds, they could cause magic showers and fires, they observed
stars and clouds, they told lucky days,<a name="FNanchor_18_153" id="FNanchor_18_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_153" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> they had ordeals of their
own,<a name="FNanchor_19_154" id="FNanchor_19_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_154" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> but, above all, they appear to have been tutors or teachers.</p>

<p>Another druidic practice which is mentioned in Cormac's
Glossary is more fully treated of by Keating, in his account
of the great pagan convention at Uisneach, a hill in Meath,
"where the men of Ireland were wont to exchange their
goods and their wares and other jewels." This convention
was held in the month of May,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And at it they were wont to make a sacrifice to the arch-god,
whom they adored, whose name was Bél. It was likewise their
usage to light two fires to Bél in every district in Ireland at this
season, and to drive a pair of each herd of cattle that the district
contained between these two fires, as a preservative, to guard them
against all the diseases of that year. It is from that fire thus made
that the day on which the noble feast of the apostles Peter and
James is held has been called Bealtaine [in Scotch Beltane], <i>i.e.</i>,
Bél's fire."</p></blockquote>

<p>Cormac, however, says nothing about a god named Bél&mdash;who,
indeed, is only once mentioned elsewhere, so far as I know<a name="FNanchor_20_155" id="FNanchor_20_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_155" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>&mdash;but
explains the name as if it were Bil-tene, "goodly fire,"
from the fires which the druids made on that day through
which to drive the cattle.<a name="FNanchor_21_156" id="FNanchor_21_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_156" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Post-Christian accounts of the druids as a whole, and or
individual druids differ widely. The notes on St. Patrick,
in the Book of Armagh, present them in the worst
possible light as wicked wizards and augurs and people of
incantations,<a name="FNanchor_22_157" id="FNanchor_22_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_157" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and the Latin lives of the Saints nearly always
call them "magi." Yet they are admitted to have been able
to prophecy. King Laoghaire's [Leary's] druids prophesied
to him three years before the arrival of Patrick that "adze-heads
would come over a furious sea,"</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Their mantles hole-headed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their staves crook-headed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their tables in the east of their houses."<a name="FNanchor_23_158" id="FNanchor_23_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_158" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>In the lives of the early saints we find some of them on
fair terms with the druids. Columcille's first teacher was a
druid, whom his mother consulted about him. It is true that
in the Lismore text he is called not a druid but a <i>fáidh, i.e.,
vates</i> or prophet, but this only confirms the close connection
between druid, prophet, and teacher, for his proceedings are
distinctly druidical, the account runs: "Now when the time
for reading came to him the cleric went to a certain prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
who abode in the land to ask him when the boy ought to
begin. When the prophet had scanned the sky, he said 'Write
an alphabet for him now.' The alphabet was written on a
cake, and Columcille consumed the cake in this wise, half to
the east of a water, and half to the west of a water. Said the
prophet through grace of prophecy, 'So shall this child's
territory be, half to the east of the sea, and half to the west of
the sea.'"<a name="FNanchor_24_159" id="FNanchor_24_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_159" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Columcille himself is said to have composed a
poem beginning, "My Druid is the son of God." Another
druid prophesies of St. Brigit before she was born,<a name="FNanchor_25_160" id="FNanchor_25_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_160" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and other
instances connecting the early saints with druids are to be
found in their lives, which at least show that there existed
a sufficient number of persons in early Christian Ireland who
did not consider the druids wholly bad, but believed that
they could prophecy, at least in the interests of the saints.</p>

<p>From what we have said, it is evident that there were
always druids in Ireland, and that they were personages of
great importance. But it is not clear that they were an
organised body like the druids of Gaul,<a name="FNanchor_26_161" id="FNanchor_26_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_161" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> or like the Bardic
body in later times in Ireland, nor is it clear what their exact
functions were, but they seem to have been teachers above
everything else. It is clear, too, that the ancient Irish&mdash;at
least in some cases&mdash;possessed and worshipped images. That
they sacrificed to them, and even offered up human beings, is
by no means so certain, the evidence for this resting upon the
single passage in the Dinnseanchas, and the poem (in a modern
style of metre) in the Book of Leinster, which we have just
given, and which though it is evidence for the existence of the
idol Crom Cruach, known to us already from other sources,
may possibly have had the trait of human sacrifice added as a
heightening touch by a Christian chronicler familiar with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
accounts of Moloch and Ashtarôth. The complete silence
which, outside of these passages,<a name="FNanchor_27_162" id="FNanchor_27_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_162" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> exists in all Irish literature
as to a proceeding so terrifying to the popular imagination,
seems to me a proof that if human sacrifice was ever resorted
to at all, it had fallen into abeyance before the landing of
the Christian missionaries.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_136" id="Footnote_1_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_136"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Cæsar's words are worth repeating. He says that there were two
sorts of men in Gaul both numerous and honoured&mdash;the knights and the
Druids, "equites et druides," because the people counted for nothing and
took the initiative in nothing. As for the Druids, he says: "Rebus divinis
intersunt, sacrificia publica et privata procurant, religiones interpretantur
... nam fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt,
et si quod est admissum facinus, si c&#339;des facta, si de hereditate, de finibus
controversia est iidem decernunt præmia, p&#339;nasque constituunt." All
this seems very like the duties of the Irish Druids, but not what follows:
"si qui, aut privatus aut populus eorum decreto non stetit, sacrificiis interdicunt.
Hæc p&#339;na apud eos est gravissima." Nor do the Irish appear
to have had the over-Druid whom Cæsar talks of. (<i>See</i> "De Bello Gallico,"
book vi. chaps. 13, 14).</p></div>

Mogue, contained in H. 2, 6: "I searched the two Brefneys for the
situation of Moy Sleacht on which stood the chief pagan Irish idol Crom
Cruach, but have failed, being misled by Lanigan, who had been misled by
Seward, who had been blinded by the impostor Beauford, who placed
this plain in the county of Leitrim. It can, however, be proved from this
life of St. Mogue that Magh Sleacht was that level part of the Barony of
Tullaghan (in the county of Cavan) in which the island of Inis Breaghwee
(now Mogue's Island), the church of Templeport, and the little village
of Ballymagauran are situated." I have been told that O'Donovan

translating Cenn Cruach by <i>tête sanglante</i> and Crom Cruach by <i>Courbe

"a reek" or "mound," as in Croagh-Patrick, St. Patrick's Reek. Cenn
Cruach is evidently the same name as the Roman station Penno-Crucium,
in the present county of Stafford, the Irish "c" being as usual the equivalent
of the British "p." This would make it appear that Cromm was no local
idol. Rhys thinks it got its name Crom Cruach, "the stooped one of the
mound," from its bent attitude in the days of its decadence.</p></div>

ceremonies, took the harm out of them by transferring them to St. John's
Eve, the 24th of June, where they are still observed in most districts of
Ireland, and large fires built with bones in them, and occasionally cattle
are driven through them or people leap over them. The cattle were probably
driven through the fire as a kind of substitute for their sacrifice,
and the bones burnt in the fire are probably a substitute for the bones
of the cattle that should have been offered up. Hence the fires are
called "teine cnámh" (bone-fire) in Irish, and b&#333;ne-fire (not b&#335;nfire) in
English.</p></div>

of Ballymote, but this is recorded in connection with funeral games, and
appears to have been an isolated piece of barbarity performed "that it
might be a reproach to the Momonians for ever, and that it might be a
trophy over them." Fiachra, a brother of Niall of the Nine Hostages, in
the fourth century, carried off fifty hostages from Munster, and dying of
his wounds, the hostages were buried alive with him, round his grave:
"ro hadnaicead na geill tucadh a neass ocus siad beo im fheart Fiachra
comba hail for Mumain do gres, ocus comba comrama forra." For
another allusion to "human sacrifice" see O'Curry's "Manners and
Customs," vol. i. p. dcxli and cccxxxiii. The "Dinnseanchas," quoted
from above, is a topographical work explaining the origin of Irish place-names,
and attributed to Amergin mac Amhalgaidh, poet to King Diarmuid
mac Cearbaill, who lived in the sixth century. "There seems no reason," says
Dr. Atkinson, in his preface to the facsimile Book of Leinster, "for disputing
his claims to be regarded as the original compiler of a work of a similar
character&mdash;the original nucleus is not now determinable." The oldest
copy is the Book of Leinster and treats of nearly two hundred places and
contains eighty-eight poems. The copy in the Book of Ballymote contains
one hundred and thirty-nine, and that in the Book of Lecan even more.
The total number of all the poems contained in the different copies is
close on one hundred and seventy. The copy in the Bodleian Library
was published by Whitley Stokes in "Folk-lore," December, 1892, and
that in the Advocates Library, in Edinburgh, in "Folk-lore," December,
1893. The prose tales, from a copy at Rennes, he published in the "Revue
Celtique," vols. xv. and xvi. An edition of the oldest copy in the Book
of Leinster is still a desideratum. The whole work is full of interesting
pagan allusions, but the different copies, in the case of many names, vary
greatly and even contradict each other.</p></div>

<h4>THE IRISH ELYSIUM AND BELIEF IN REBIRTH</h4>


<p>Cæsar, writing some fifty years before Christ about the
Gauls and their Druids, tells his countrymen that one of the
prime articles which they taught was that men's souls do not
die&mdash;<i>non interire animas</i>&mdash;"but passed over after death from
one into another," and their opinion is, adds Cæsar, that this
doctrine "greatly tends to the arousing of valour, all fear of
death being despised."<a name="FNanchor_1_163" id="FNanchor_1_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_163" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A few years later Diodorus Siculus
wrote that one of their doctrines was "that the souls of men
are undying, and that after finishing their term of existence
they pass into another body," adding that at burials of the
dead some actually cast letters addressed to their departed
relatives upon the funeral pile, under the belief that the dead
would read them in the next world. Timagenes, a Greek who
wrote a history of Gaul now lost, Strabo, Valerius Maximus,
Pomponius Mela, and Lucan<a name="FNanchor_2_164" id="FNanchor_2_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_164" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in his "Pharsalia," all have
passages upon this vivid belief of the Gauls that the soul
lived again. This doctrine must also have been current in
Britain, where the Druidic teaching was, to use Cæsar's phrase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
"discovered, and thence brought into Gaul," and it would
have been curious indeed if Ireland did not share in it.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, abundant evidence to show that the
doctrine of metempsychosis was perfectly familiar to the pagan
Irish, as may be seen in the stories of the births of Cuchulain,
Etain, the Two Swineherds, Conall Cearnach, Tuan Mac
Cairill, and Aedh Sláne.<a name="FNanchor_3_165" id="FNanchor_3_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_165" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But there is not, in our existing
literature, any evidence that the belief was ever elevated into
a philosophical doctrine of general acceptance, applicable to
every one, still less that there was ever any ethical stress laid
upon the belief in rebirth. It is only the mythological
element in the belief in metempsychosis which has come down
to us, and from which we ascertain that the pagan Irish
believed that supernatural beings could become clothed in flesh
and blood, could enter into women and be born again, could
take different shapes and pass through different stages of
existence, as fowls, animals, or men. What the actual
doctrinal form of the familiar idea was, or how far it influenced
the popular mind, we have no means of knowing. But as
Mr. Nutt well remarks, "early Irish religion must have
possessed some ritual, and what in default of an apter term
must be styled philosophical as well as mythological elements.
Practically the latter alone have come down to us, and that in
a romantic rather than in a strictly mythical form. Could
we judge Greek religion aright if fragments of Apollodorus or
the 'Metamorphoses' were all that survived of the literature it
inspired?"<a name="FNanchor_4_166" id="FNanchor_4_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_166" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The most that can be said upon the subject, then,
is that the doctrine of rebirth was actually taught with a
deliberate ethical purpose&mdash;that of making men brave, since on
being slain in this life they passed into a new one&mdash;amongst
the Celts of Gaul, that it must have been familiar to the
Britons between whose Druids and those of Gaul so close a
resemblance subsisted, and that the idea of rebirth which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
forms part of half-a-dozen existing Irish sagas, was perfectly
familiar to the Irish Gael, although we have no evidence that
it was connected with any ritual or taught as a deliberate
doctrine.</p>

<p>In reconstructing from our existing literature the beliefs and
religion of our ancestors, we can only do so incompletely, and
with difficulty, from passages in the oldest sagas and other
antique fragments, mostly of pagan origin, from allusions in
very early poems, from scanty notices in the annals, and from
the lives of early saints. The relatively rapid conversion of the
island to Christianity in the fifth century, and the enthusiasm
with which the new religion was received, militated against
any full transmission of pagan belief or custom. We cannot
now tell whether all the ancient Irish were imbued with the
same religious beliefs, or whether these varied&mdash;as they probably
did&mdash;from tribe to tribe. Probably all the Celtic races, even
in their most backward state, believed&mdash;so far as they had any
persuasion on the subject at all&mdash;in the immortality of the soul.
Where the souls of the dead went to, when they were not reincarnated,
is not so clear. They certainly believed in a happy
Other-World, peopled by a happy race, whither people were
sometimes carried whilst still alive, and to gain which they
either traversed the sea to the north-west, or else entered one
of the Sidh [Shee] mounds, or else again dived beneath the
water.<a name="FNanchor_5_167" id="FNanchor_5_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_167" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In all cases, however, whatever the mode of access,
the result is much the same. A beautiful country is discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
where a happy race free from care, sickness, and death, spend
the smiling hours in simple, sensuous pleasures.</p>

<p>There is a graphic description of this Elysium in the "Voyage
of Bran," a poem evidently pagan,<a name="FNanchor_6_168" id="FNanchor_6_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_168" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and embodying purely
pagan conceptions. A mysterious female, an emissary from
the lovely land, appears in Bran's household one day, when the
doors were closed and the house full of chiefs and princes, and
no one knew whence she came, and she chanted to them
twenty-eight quatrains describing the delights of the pleasant
country.</p>

and chants to him twenty-eight more verses about the lovely

lady had described, and they are couched in the same strain.</p>

description, at once so mystic and so sensuous, of the joys of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the other world. To my mind it breathes the very essence of
Celtic glamour, and is shot through and through with the
Celtic love of form, beauty, landscape, company, and the
society of woman. How exquisite the idea of being transported
from this world to an isle around which sea-horses
glisten, where from trees covered with blossoms the birds call
in harmony to the Hours, a land whose haze is incomparable!
What a touch! Where hair of crystal drops from the mane
of the wave as it washes against the land; where the chariots
of silver and of bronze assemble on the plain of sports,
in the country against which laughter peals, and the day of
lasting weather showers silver on the land. And then to play
sitting at the luxurious wine&mdash;</p>

<p>I verily believe there is no Gael alive even now who would
not in his heart of hearts let drift by him the Elysiums of
Virgil, Dante, and Milton to grasp at the Moy Mell of the
unknown Irish pagan.</p>

<p>In another perhaps equally ancient story, that of the elopement
of Connla, son of Conn of the Hundred Battles,<a name="FNanchor_8_170" id="FNanchor_8_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_170" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> with a
lady who is a denizen of this mysterious land, we find the
unknown visitor giving nearly the same account of it as that
given to Bran.</p>

<p>"Whence hast thou come, O Lady?" said the Druid.</p>

<p>"I have come," said she, "from the lands of the living in
which there is neither death, nor sin, nor strife;<a name="FNanchor_9_171" id="FNanchor_9_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_171" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> we enjoy
perpetual feasts without anxiety, and benevolence without
contention. A large Sidh [<i>Shee</i>, "fairy-mound"] is where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
dwell, so that it is hence we are called the Sidh [Shee]
people."</p>

<p>The Druids appear, as I have already remarked, to have
acted as intermediaries between the inhabitants of the other
world and of this, and in the story of Connla one of them
chants against the lady so that her voice was not heard, and he
drives her away through his incantation. She comes back,
however, at the end of a month, and again summons the prince.</p>

<p>"'Tis no lofty seat," she chanted, "upon which sits Connla
amid short-lived mortals awaiting fearful death; the ever-living
ones invite thee to be the ruler over the men of Tethra."</p>

<p>Conn of the Hundred Battles, who had overheard her
speech, cried, "Call me the Druid; I see her tongue has
been allowed her to-day [again]."</p>

<p>But she invisible to all save the prince replied to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Conn of the Hundred Battles, druidism is not loved,
for little has it progressed to honour on the great Righteous
Strand, with its numerous, wondrous, various families."</p>

<p>After that she again invites the prince to follow her,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"There is another land which it were well to seek.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see the bright sun is descending, though far off we shall reach it ere night.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis the land that cheers the mind of every one that turns to me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no race in it save only women and maidens."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The prince is overcome with longing. He leaps into her
well-balanced, gleaming boat of pearl. Those who were left
behind upon the strand "saw them dimly, as far as the sight
of their eyes could reach. They sailed the sea away from
them, and from that day to this have not been seen, and it is
unknown where they went to."</p>

<p>In the fine story of Cuchulain's sick-bed,<a name="FNanchor_10_172" id="FNanchor_10_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_172" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in which though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the language of the text is not so ancient, the conceptions
are equally pagan, the deserted wife of Manannán, the Irish
Neptune, falls in love with the human warrior, and invites
him to the other-world to herself, through the medium of an
ambassadress. Cuchulain sends his charioteer Laeg along with
this mysterious ambassadress, that he may bring him word
again, to what kind of land he is invited. Laeg, when he
returns, repeats a glowing account of its beauty, which
coincides closely with those given by the ladies who summoned
Bran and Connla.</p>

the Tuatha De Danann, is reborn as a mortal, and weds the
king of Ireland. Her former husband, Midir, still loves her,
follows her, and tries to win her back. She is unwilling, and
he chants to her this description of the land to which he would
lure her.</p>

<p>The casual Christian allusion in the penultimate verse need
not lead us astray, nor does it detract from the essentially
pagan character of the rest, for throughout almost the whole
of Irish literature the more distinctly or ferociously pagan any
piece is, the more certain it is to have a Christian allusion
added at the end as a make-weight. There is great ingenuity
displayed in thus turning the pagan legend into a Christian
homily by the addition of two lines suggesting that if men
were not sinful, this beautiful pagan world and the beautiful
forms that inhabited it would be visible to the human ken.
This was sufficient to disarm any hostility to the legend on the
part of the Church.</p>

<p>From what we have said it is evident that the ancient Irish
pagans believed in the possibility of rebirth, and founded
many of their mythical sagas on the doctrine of metempsychosis,
and that they had a highly ornate and fully-developed belief in
a happy other-world or Elysium, to which living beings were
sometimes carried off without going through the forms of
death. But it is impossible to say whether rebirth with life
in another world, for those whom the gods favoured, was
taught as a doctrine or had any ethical significance attached to
it by the druids of Ireland, as it most undoubtedly had by
their cousins the druids of Gaul.</p>

<h4>EARLY USE OF LETTERS, OGAM AND ROMAN</h4>


<p>We now come to the question, When and where did the Irish
get their alphabet, and at what time did they begin to practise
the art of writing? The present alphabet of the Irish, which
they have used in all their books from the seventh century
down, and probably for three hundred years before that, is only
a modification&mdash;and a peculiarly beautiful one&mdash;of the Roman
letters. This alphabet they no doubt borrowed from their
neighbours, the Romanised Britons, within whose territory
they had established themselves, and with whom&mdash;now in
peace, now in war&mdash;they carried on a vigorous and constant
intercourse.<a name="FNanchor_1_175" id="FNanchor_1_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_175" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The <i>general</i> use of letters in Ireland is, however,
to be attributed to the early Christian missionaries.</p>

<p>But there is no reason to believe that it was St. Patrick, or
indeed any missionary, who first introduced them. There
probably were in Ireland many persons in the fourth century,
or perhaps even earlier, who were acquainted with the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
writing. Already, at the beginning of the third century at
least, says Zimmer in his "Keltische Studien," British
missionaries were at work in the south of Ireland. Bede, in
his history, says distinctly that Palladius was sent from Rome
in the year 431 to the Irish "who believed in Christ"&mdash;"ad
Scottos in Christum credentes." Already, at the close of the
third century, there was an organised British episcopate, and
three British bishops attended the Council of Arles held in
314. It is quite impossible that the numerous Irish colonies
settled in the south of England and in Wales could have
failed to come into contact with this organised Church, and
even to have been influenced by it. The account in the
Acta Sanctorum, of Declan, Bishop of Waterford, said to
have been born in 347, and of Ailbe, another southern bishop,
who met St. Patrick, may be looked upon as perfectly true
in so far as it relates to the actual existence of these pre-Patrician
bishops. St. Chrysostom, writing in the year 387,
mentions that already churches and altars had been erected in
the British Isles. Pelagius, the subtle and persuasive heresiarch
who taught with such success at Rome about the year 400,
and acquired great influence there, was of Irish descent&mdash;"habet
progeniem Scotticæ gentis de Brittanorum vicinia," said St.
Jerome. As St. Augustine and Prosper of Aquitaine call
him "Briton" and "British scribe," he probably belonged to
one of the Irish colonies settled in Wales or the South-west of
England. His success at Rome is a proof that some Irish
families at least were within reach of literary education in the
fourth century. His friend and teacher, Celestius, has also
been claimed as an Irishman, but Dr. Healy has shown that
this claim is perhaps founded upon a misconception.<a name="FNanchor_2_176" id="FNanchor_2_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_176" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"The influence of the ancient Irish on the Continent,"
says Dr. Sigerson, "began in the works of Sedulius,
whose 'Carmen Paschale,' published in the fifth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
is the first great Christian epic worthy of the name."
Sedulius, the Virgil of theological poetry, flourished in
the first half of the fifth century, and seems to have
studied in Gaul, passed into Italy, and finally resided in
Achaia in Greece, which he seems to have made his
home. There are at least eight Irish Siadals (in Latin
Sedulius, in English Shiel) commemorated by Colgan. The
strongest evidence of Sedulius's Irish nationality is that the
Irish geographer Dicuil, in the eighth century, quoting some
of his lines, calls him <i>noster Sedulius</i>. John of Tritenheim,
towards the close of the fifteenth century, distinctly calls him
an Irishman <i>natione Scotus</i>, but attributes to him the verses
of a later Sedulius. Dr. Sigerson, by a clever analysis of his
verse-peculiarities confirms this opinion.<a name="FNanchor_3_177" id="FNanchor_3_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_177" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In the "Tripartite Life of St. Patrick" we read that the
druids at the king's court, when St. Patrick arrived there,
possessed books, and when, at a later date, St. Patrick determined
upon revising the Brehon law code, the books in
which it was written down were laid before him. That there
has come down to our time no written record earlier than the
seventh or eighth century<a name="FNanchor_4_178" id="FNanchor_4_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_178" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is chiefly due to the enormous
destruction of books by the Danes and English. The same
causes produced a like effect in Britain, for the oldest surviving
British MSS. are not even as old as ours, although the art of
writing must have been known and practised there since the
Roman occupation.</p>

<p>The Irish had, however, another system of writing which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
they themselves invented. This was the celebrated Ogam
script, consisting of a number of short lines, straight or slanting,<a name="FNanchor_5_179" id="FNanchor_5_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_179" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and drawn either below, above, or through one long
stem-line, which stem-line is generally the angle between two
sides of a long upright rectangular stone. These lines represented
letters; and over two hundred stones have been found
inscribed with Ogam writing. It is a remarkable fact that
rude as this device for writing is, it has been applied with
considerable skill, and is framed with much ingenuity. For in
every case it is found that those letters which, like the vowels,
are most easily pronounced, are also in Ogam the easiest to
inscribe, and the simpler sounds are represented by simpler
characters than those that are more complex. To account for
the philosophical character of this alphabet<a name="FNanchor_6_180" id="FNanchor_6_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_180" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "than which no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
simpler method of writing is imaginable," a German, Dr.
Rethwisch, who examined it from this side, concluded that
"the natural gifts of the Celts and their practical genius for
simplicity and observation ripened up to a certain stage far
earlier than those of their Indo-European relations." This
statement, however, rests upon the as yet unproved assumption
that Ogam writing is pre-Christian and pagan. What
is of more interest is that the author of it supposed that with
one or two changes it would make the simplest conceivable
universal-alphabet or international code of writing. It is very
strange that nearly all the Irish Ogam stones are found in the
south-west, chiefly in the counties of Cork and Kerry, with
a few scattered over the rest of the country&mdash;but one in West
Connacht, and but one or two at the most in Ulster.
Between twenty and thirty more have been found in Wales
and Devonshire, and one or two even farther east, thus bearing
witness to the colonies planted by the Irish marauders in
early Britain, for Ogam writing is peculiar to the Irish Gael
and only found where he had settled. Ten stones more have
been found in Scotland, probably the latest in date of any, for
some of these, unlike the Irish stones, bear Christian symbols.
Many Ogams have been easily read, thanks to the key contained
in the Book of Ballymote; thanks also to the fact that
one or two Ogams have been found with duplicates inscribed
in Latin letters. But many still defy all attempts at deciphering
them, though numerous efforts have been made, treating
them as though they were cryptic ciphers, which they were
long believed to be. That Ogam was, as some assert, an
early cryptic alphabet, and one intended to be read only by
the initiated, is both in face of the numbers of such inscriptions
already deciphered and in the face of the many instances
recorded in our oldest sagas of its employment, an absurd
hypothesis. It is nearly always treated in them as an ordinary
script which any one could read. It may, however, have been
occasionally used in later times in a cryptic sense, names being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
written backwards or syllables transposed, but this was certainly
not the original invention. Some of the latest Ogam pillars
are gravestones of people who died so late as the year 600,
but what proportion of them, if any, date from before the
Christian era it is as yet impossible to tell. Certain it is that
the grammatical forms of the language inscribed upon most of
them are vastly older than those of the very oldest manuscripts,<a name="FNanchor_7_181" id="FNanchor_7_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_181" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and agree with those of the old Gaulish linguistic monuments.</p>

<p>Cormac's Glossary&mdash;a work of the ninth or tenth century&mdash;the
ancient sagas, and many allusions in the older literature,
would seem to show that Ogam writing was used by the
pagan Irish. Cormac, explaining the word <i>fé</i> says that "it
was a wooden rod used by the Gael for measuring corpses
and graves, and that this rod used always to be kept in the
burial-places of the heathen, and it was a horror to every
one even to take it in his hand, and whatever was abominable
to them they (the pagans) used to inscribe on it in Ogam."<a name="FNanchor_8_182" id="FNanchor_8_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_182" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The sagas also are full of allusions to Ogam writing. In the
"Táin Bo Chuailgne," which probably assumed substantially
its present shape in the seventh century, we are told how
when Cuchulain, after assuming arms, drove into Leinster with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
his charioteer and came to the dún or fort of the three sons
of Nechtan, he found on the lawn before the court a stone
pillar, around which was written in Ogam that every hero
who passed thereby was bound to issue a challenge. This was
clearly no cryptic writing but the ordinary script, meant to be
read by every one who passed.<a name="FNanchor_9_183" id="FNanchor_9_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_183" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Cuchulain in the same saga
frequently cuts Ogam on wands, which he leaves in the way
of Mève's army. These are always brought to his friend
Fergus to read. Perhaps the next oldest allusion to Ogam
writing is in the thoroughly pagan "Voyage of Bran," which
both Zimmer and Kuno Meyer consider to have been committed
to writing in the seventh century. We are there told
that Bran wrote the fifty or sixty quatrains of the poem in
Ogam. Again, in Cormac's Glossary<a name="FNanchor_10_184" id="FNanchor_10_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_184" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> we find a story of how
Lomna Finn mac Cool's fool (drúth) made an Ogam and
put it in Finn's way to tell him how his wife had been
unfaithful to him. A more curious case is the story in the
Book of Leinster of Corc's flying to the Court of King
Feradach in Scotland. Not knowing how he might be
received he hid in a wood near by. The King's poet, however,
meets him and recognises him, having seen him before
that in Ireland. The poet notices an Ogam on the prince's
shield, and asks him, "Who was it that befriended you with
that Ogam, for it was not good luck which he designed for
you?" "Why," asked the prince, "what does it contain?"
"What it contains," said the poet, "is this&mdash;that if by day
you arrive at the Court of Feradach the king, your head shall
be struck off before night; if it be at night you arrive your
head shall be struck off before morning."<a name="FNanchor_11_185" id="FNanchor_11_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_185" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This Ogam was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
apparently readable only by the initiated, for the prince did not
himself know what he was bearing on his shield.</p>

<p>All ancient Irish literature, then, is unanimous in attributing
a knowledge of Ogam to the pre-Christian Irish. M. d'Arbois
de Jubainville seems also to believe in its pagan antiquity, for
when discussing the story of St. Patrick's setting a Latin
alphabet before Fiach, and of the youth's learning to read the
Psalms within the following four-and-twenty hours, he remarks
that the story is just possible since Fiach should have known
the Ogam alphabet, and except for the form of the letters it
and the Latin alphabet were the same.<a name="FNanchor_12_186" id="FNanchor_12_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_186" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>St. Patrick, too, tells us in his "Confession" how after his
flight from Ireland he saw a man coming as it were from that
country with innumerable letters, a dream that would scarcely
have visited him had he known that there was no one in
Ireland who could write letters.<a name="FNanchor_13_187" id="FNanchor_13_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_187" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Ogam alphabet, however, is based upon the Roman.
Of this there can be no doubt, for it contains letters which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
according to the key, represents Q (made by five upright
strokes above the stem line), Z, and Y, none of which letters
are used in even the oldest MSS., and two of which at least must
have been borrowed from the Romans. The most, then, that
can at present be said with absolute certainty is, as Dr. Whitley
Stokes cautiously puts it, that these Ogam inscriptions and the
language in which they are couched are "enough to show that
some of the Celts of these islands wrote their language before
the fifth century, the time at which Christianity is supposed to
have been introduced into Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_14_188" id="FNanchor_14_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_188" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The presence of these
Roman letters never used by the Irish on vellum, and the
absence of any aspirated letters (which abound even in the
oldest vellum MSS.) are additional proofs of the antiquity of
the Ogam alphabet.</p>

<p>The Irish themselves ascribed the invention of Ogam to
[the god] Ogma, one of the leading Tuatha De Danann,<a name="FNanchor_15_189" id="FNanchor_15_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_189" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and although it may be, as Rhys points out, philologically
unsound to derive Ogam from Ogma, yet there appears to be
an intimate connection between the two words, and Ogma
may well be derived from Ogam, which in its early stage may
have meant fluency or learning rather than letters. Certainly
there cannot be any doubt that Ogma, the Tuatha De Danann,
was the same as the Gaulish god Ogmios of whom Lucian,
that pleasantest of Hellenes, gives us an account so delightfully
graphic that it is worth repeating in its entirety as another
proof of what I shall have more to speak about later on, the
solidarity&mdash;to use a useful Gallicism&mdash;of the Irish and the
Continental Gauls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Celts,"<a name="FNanchor_16_190" id="FNanchor_16_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_190" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> says Lucian, "call Heracles in the language of their
country Ogmios, and they make very strange representations of the
god. With them he is an extremely old man with a bald forehead
and his few remaining hairs quite grey; his skin is wrinkled and
embrowned by the sun to that degree of swarthiness which is characteristic
of men who have grown old in a seafaring life; in fact,
you would fancy him rather to be a Charon or Japetus, one of the
dwellers in Tartarus, or anybody rather than Heracles. But although
he is of this description he is nevertheless attired like Heracles, for
he has on him the lion's skin, and he has a club in the right hand;
he is duly equipped with a quiver, and his left hand displays a bow
stretched out, in these respects he is quite Heracles.<a name="FNanchor_17_191" id="FNanchor_17_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_191" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It struck me
then that the Celts took such liberties with the appearance of
Heracles in order to insult the gods of the Greeks and avenge
themselves on him in their painting, because he once made a raid
on their territory, when in search of the herds of Geryon he harassed
most of the Western peoples. I have not yet, however, mentioned
the most whimsical part of the picture, for this old man Heracles
draws after him a great number of men bound by their ears, and the
bonds are slender cords wrought of gold and amber, like necklaces
of the most beautiful make; and although they are dragged on by
such weak ties they never try to run away, though they could easily
do it, nor do they at all resist or struggle against them, planting their
feet in the ground and throwing their weight back in the direction
contrary to that in which they are being led. Quite the reverse,
they follow with joyful countenance in a merry mood, and praising
him who leads them, pressing on, one and all, and slackening their
chains in their eagerness to proceed; in fact, they look like men
who would be grieved should they be set free. But that which
seemed to me the most absurd thing of all I will not hesitate also to
tell you: the painter, you see, had nowhere to fix the ends of the
cords since the right hand of the god held the club and his left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
bow; so he pierced the tip of his tongue and represented the people
as drawn on from it, and the god turns a smiling countenance
towards those whom he is leading. Now I stood a long time looking
at these things and wondered, perplexed and indignant. But
a certain Celt standing by, who knew something about our ways,
as he showed by speaking good Greek&mdash;a man who was quite
a philosopher I take it in local matters&mdash;said to me: 'Stranger,
I will tell you the secret of the painting, for you seem very
much troubled about it. We Celts do not consider the power
of speech to be Hermes as you Greeks do, but we represent it by
means of Heracles, because he is much stronger than Hermes. Nor
should you wonder at his being represented as an old man, for the
power of words is wont to show its perfection in the aged; for your
poets are, no doubt, right when they say that the thoughts of young
men turn with every wind, and that age has something wiser to tell
us than youth. And so it is that honey pours from the tongue of that
Nestor of yours, and the Trojan orators speak with a voice of the
delicacy of the lily, a voice well covered, so to say, with bloom, for
the bloom of flowers, if my memory does not fail me, has the term
lilies applied to it. So if this old man Heracles (the power of speech)
draws men after him, tied to his tongue by their ears, you have no
reason to wonder; as you must be aware of the close connection
between the ears and the tongue. Nor is there any injury done him
by the latter being pierced; for I remember, said he, learning, while
among you, some comic iambics to the effect that all chattering
fellows have the tongue bored at the tip. In a word, we Celts are
of opinion that Heracles himself performed everything by the
power of words, as he was a wise fellow, and that most of his compulsion
was effected by persuasion. His weapons, I take it, were his
utterances, which are sharp and well-aimed, swift to pierce the
mind, and you too say that words have wings.' Thus far the
Celt."</p></blockquote>

<p>We see, then, that the Irish legend that it was Ogma (who
is also said to have been skilled in dialects and poetry) who
invented the Ogam alphabet, so useful as a medium through
which to convey language, is quite borne out by the account
given to Lucian of the Gaulish god Ogmios, the eloquent old
man whose language was endowed with so great a charm that
he took his hearers captive. He turns, says Lucian, towards
his willing captives with a smiling face, and the Irish Ogma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
too, is called Ogma "of the shining countenance."<a name="FNanchor_18_192" id="FNanchor_18_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_192" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Nor
does the Gaul in dressing Ogma as a Hercules appear to have
acted altogether whimsically, because not only is Ogma skilled
in poetry and dialects and the inventor of Ogam, but he is
also all through the battle of Moytura actually depicted as the
<i>strong man</i> of the De Danann, strong enough to push a stone
which eighty pair of oxen could not have moved.</p>

<p>The modern Irish names for books, reading, writing, letters,
pens, and vellum, are all derived from the Latin.<a name="FNanchor_19_193" id="FNanchor_19_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_193" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But there
seem to have been other names in use to designate the early
writing materials of the Irish. These were the Taibhli
Fileadh, "poets' tablets," and Tamhlorg Fileadh, which is
translated by O'Curry as poets' "headless staves." This
latter word, whatever may be the exact meaning of it, is at
least pure Gaelic. We read in the "Colloquy of the Ancients"
that St. Patrick began to feel a little uneasy at the delight
with which he listened to the stories of the ancient Fenians,
and in his over-scrupulous sanctity he feared it might be
wrong to extract such pleasure from merely mundane narrations.
Accordingly he consulted his two guardian angels on
the matter, but received an emphatic response from both of
them, not only to the effect that there was no harm in listening
to the stories themselves, but actually desiring him to get
them written down "in poets' <i>támhlorgs</i> and in the words of
ollavs, for it will be a rejoicing to numbers and to the good
people to the end of time, to listen to those stories."<a name="FNanchor_20_194" id="FNanchor_20_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_194" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
ancient passage from the Brehon Laws prescribes that a poet
may carry a <i>tábhall-lorg</i> or tablet-staff, and O'Curry acutely
suggests that these so-called tablet-staves were of the nature of
a fan which could be closed up in the shape of a square stick,
upon the lines and angles of which the poet wrote in Ogam.
We can well imagine the almost superstitious reverence which
in rude times must have attached itself, and which as we know
did attach itself, to the man who could carry about in his
hand the whole history and genealogy of his race, and probably
the catchwords of innumerable poems and the skeletons
of highly-prized narratives. It was probably through these
means that the genealogies of which I have spoken were so
accurately transmitted and kept from the third or fourth
century, and possibly from a still earlier period.</p>

<p>Amongst many other accounts of pre-Christian writing
there is one so curious that it is worth giving here <i>in extenso.</i><a name="FNanchor_21_195" id="FNanchor_21_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_195" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<h5>THE STORY OF BAILE MAC BUAIN, THE SWEET-SPOKEN.</h5>


<p>"Buain's only son was Baile. He was specially beloved by
Aillinn,<a name="FNanchor_22_196" id="FNanchor_22_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_196" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the daughter of Lewy,<a name="FNanchor_23_197" id="FNanchor_23_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_197" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> son of Fergus Fairgé&mdash;but some say
she was the daughter of Owen, son of Dathi&mdash;and he was specially
beloved not of her only, but of every one who ever heard or saw
him, on account of his delightful stories.</p>

<p>"Now Baile and Aillinn made an appointment to meet at Rosnaree,
on the banks of the Boyne in Bregia. And he came from Emania
in the north to meet her, passing over Slieve Fuad and Muirthuimhne
to Tráigh mBaile (Dundalk), and here he and his troops unyoked
their chariots, sent their horses out to pasture, and gave themselves
up to pleasure and happiness.</p>

<p>"And while they were there they saw a horrible spectral personage
coming towards them from the South. Vehement were his steps and
his rapid progress. The way he sped over the earth might be compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
to the darting of a hawk down a cliff or to wind from off the
green sea, and his left was towards the land [<i>i.e.</i>, he came from the
south along the shore].</p>

<p>"'Go meet him,' said Baile, 'and ask him where he goes, or
whence he comes, or what is the cause of his haste.'</p>

<p>"'From Mount Leinster I come, and I go back now to the North,
to the mouth of the river Bann; and I have no news but of the
daughter of Lewy, son of Fergus, who had fallen in love with Baile
mac Buain, and was coming to meet him. But the youths of Leinster
overtook her, and she died from being forcibly detained, as Druids
and fair prophets had prophesied, for they foretold that they would
never meet in life, but that they would meet after death, and not
part for ever. There is my news,' and he darted away from them
like a blast of wind over the green sea, and they were not able to
detain him.</p>

<p>"When Baile heard this he fell dead without life, and his tomb
and his rath were raised, and his stone set up, and his funeral games
were performed by the Ultonians.</p>

<p>"And a yew grew up through his grave, and the form and shape
of Baile's head was visible on the top of it&mdash;whence the place is
called Baile's Strand [now Dundalk].</p>

<p>"Afterwards the same man went to the South to where the maiden
Aillinn was, and went into her grianan or sunny chamber.</p>

<p>"'Whence comes the man whom we do not know?' said the
maiden.</p>

<p>"'From the northern half of Erin, from the mouth of the Bann I
come, and I go past this to Mount Leinster.'</p>

<p>"'You have news?' said the maiden.</p>

<p>"'I have no news worth mentioning now, only I saw the Ultonians
performing the funeral games and digging the rath, and setting up
the stone, and writing the name of Baile mac Buain, the royal heir
of Ulster, by the side of the strand of Baile, who died while on his
way to meet a sweetheart and a beloved woman to whom he had
given affection, for it was not fated for them to meet, in life, or for
one of them to see the other living,' and he darted out after telling
the evil news.</p>

<p>"And Aillinn fell dead without life, and her tomb was raised, etc.
And an apple tree grew through her grave and became a great tree
at the end of seven years, and the shape of Aillinn's head was upon
its top.</p>

<p>"Now at the end of seven years poets and prophets and visioners
cut down the yew which was over the grave of Baile, and they made
a <i>poet's tablet</i> of it, and they wrote the visions and the espousals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the loves and the courtships of Ulster in it. [The apple tree which
grew over the grave of Aillinn was also cut down] and in like
manner the courtships of Leinster were written in it.</p>

<p>"There came a November eve long afterwards, and a festival was
made to celebrate it by Art, the son of Conn [of the Hundred Battles,
High-king of Ireland], and the professors of every science came to
that feast as was their custom, and they brought their tablets with
them. And these tablets also came there, and Art saw them, and
when he saw them he asked for them; and the two tablets were
brought and he held them in his hands face to face. Suddenly the
one tablet of them sprang upon the other, and they became united
the same as a woodbine round a twig, and it was not possible to
separate them. And they were preserved like every other jewel in
the treasury at Tara until it was burned by Dúnlang, son of Enna,
at the time he burnt the Princesses at Tara, as has been said</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'The apple tree of noble Aillinn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The yew of Baile&mdash;small inheritance&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though they are introduced into poems</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unlearned people do not understand them.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>"and Ailbhé, daughter of Cormac, grandson of Conn [of the Hundred
Battles] said too</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"'What I liken Lumluine to</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is to the Yew of Baile's rath,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What I liken the other to</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is to the Apple Tree of Aillinn.'"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>So far this strange tale. But poetic as it is, it yields&mdash;unlike
most&mdash;its chief value when rationalised, for as O'Curry
remarks, it was apparently invented to account for some inscribed
tablets in the reign of King Art in the second century,
which had&mdash;as we ourselves have seen in the case of so
many leaves of very old manuscripts at this day&mdash;become
fastened to each other, so that they clung inextricably together
and could not be separated.</p>

<p>Now the massacre of the Princesses at Tara happened,
according to the "Four Masters," in the year 241, when the
tablets were burnt. Hence one of two things must be the
case; the story must either have originated <i>before</i> that date to
account for the sticking together of the tablets, or else some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
one must have invented it long afterwards, that is, must,
without any apparent cause, have invented a story out of his
own head, as to how there were <i>once on a time</i> two tablets
made of trees which <i>once</i> grew on two tombs which were <i>once</i>
fastened together before Art, son of Conn, and which were
soon afterwards unfortunately burnt. A supposition which,
considering there were then, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, no adhering tablets
to prompt the invention, appears at first sight improbable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Brash, who made personal examination of almost every
Ogam known to exist, and whose standard work on the
subject reproduces most of the inscriptions discovered up to
the date of writing, was of opinion that no Ogam monument
had anything Christian about it, and that if any Christian
symbol were discovered on an Ogam stone, it must be of later
date than the Ogam writing. Dr. Graves, however, has
since shown that Ogam was in some few cases at least used
over the graves of Christians; and he believes that all Ogam
writing is really post-Christian, despite the absence of Christian
emblems on the stones, and that it belongs to a comparatively
modern period&mdash;"in fact, for the most part, to a time between
the fifth and seventh century."<a name="FNanchor_24_198" id="FNanchor_24_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_198" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Brash's great work was
supplemented by Sir Samuel Ferguson's, and since that time
Professor Rhys<a name="FNanchor_25_199" id="FNanchor_25_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_199" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and Dr. Whitley Stokes have thrown upon
the inscriptions themselves all the light that the highest
critical acumen equipped with the completest philological
training could do, and have, to quote Mr. Macalister,
"between them reduced to order the confusion which almost
seemed to warrant the cryptical theories, and have thereby
raised Ogam inscriptions from the position of being mere
learned playthings to a place of the highest philological importance,
not only in Celtic but in Indo-European epigraphy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
He himself&mdash;the latest to deal with the subject&mdash;waves for the
present as "difficult&mdash;perhaps in some measure insoluble"&mdash;all
"questions of the time, place, and manner of the development
of the Ogham script."<a name="FNanchor_26_200" id="FNanchor_26_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_200" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Rhys has traced in certain of
the inscriptions the influence exercised on the spoken language
of the Celtic people by an agglutinating pre-Celtic tongue.<a name="FNanchor_27_201" id="FNanchor_27_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_201" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
This gives us a glimpse at the pre-Aryan languages of the
British Isles, which is in the highest degree interesting.</p>

<p>To me it seems probable that the Irish discovered the use of
letters either through trade with the Continent or through the
Romanised Britons, at any time from the first or second century
onward. But how or why they invented the Ogam alphabet,
instead of using Roman letters, or else Greek ones like the
Gauls, is a profound mystery. One thing is certain, namely,
that the Ogam alphabet&mdash;at whatever time invented&mdash;is a
possession peculiar to the Irish Gael, and only to be found
where he made his settlements.</p>

the Irish occupied the whole of Anglesey, Carnarvon, Merioneth, and

Galway, "Lie Luguaedon Macc Lmenueh," for a facsimile of which
see O'Donovan's grammar, p. 411. O'Donovan says it was set up over a
nephew of St. Patrick's. Mr. Macalister reads it no doubt correctly, "Lie
Luguaedon macci Menueh." This is probably the oldest extant inscription
in Roman letters, and it shows that the old Ogam form <i>maqui</i> had already
changed into mac[c]i. The "c" in place of "q" is only found on the
later Ogam stones, and only one stone is found to read "maic."</p></div>

it they mean C, passing through the long line half on one side and half on
the other they mean E. These straight lines, being easily cut on stone
with a chisel, continued long in use. The long line, with reference to
which all the letters are drawn, is usually the right angle or corner of the
upright stone between the two sides. The inscription usually begins at
the left-hand corner of the stone facing the reader and is read upwards,
and is sometimes continued down on the right-hand angular line as well.
The vowels are very small cuts on the angle of the stone, but much larger
than points. There is no existing book written in Ogam, but various
alphabets of it have been preserved in the Book of Ballymote, and some
small metal articles have been found inscribed with it, showing that its
use was not peculiar to pillar stones.</p></div>

simplicity of the Ogam script] ist nur möglich wenn man annimmt dass

the genitive ending i, became incorporated in the body of the word,
making <i>Cuirc</i> and <i>maic</i> in the MSS., which latter subsequently became
attenuated still further into the modern <i>mic</i>. Another very common and
important form is <i>avi</i>, which has been explained as from a nominative
*avios [for (*p)avios], Old Irish <i>aue</i>, modern <i>ua</i> or <i>o</i>. Another extraordinary
feature is the suffix <i>*gnos = cnos</i>, the regular patronymic formative
of the Gaulish inscriptions. Another important word is <i>muco</i>, genitive
<i>mucoi</i>, meaning "descendant," but in some cases apparently "chief."
The word <i>anm</i> or even <i>ancm</i>, which often precedes the genitive of the

<p><a name="Footnote_13_187" id="Footnote_13_187"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_187"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The "Confession" and Epistles attributed to St. Patrick are, by Whitley
Stokes, Todd, Ussher, and almost all other authorities, considered genuine.
Recently J.V. Pflugk-Harttung, in an article in the "Neuer Heidelberger
Jahrbuch," Jahrgang iii., Heft. 1., 1893, has tried to show by internal
evidence that the "Confession" and Epistle, especially the former, are a little
later than St. Patrick's time, and he relies strongly on this passage, saying
that it is difficult to imagine how St. Patrick came by the idea that a
man could bring him "innumerable letters from the heathen Ireland of
that time, where, except for Ogams and inscribed stones (<i>ausser Oghams
und Skulpturzeichen</i>), the art of writing was as yet unknown." But seeing
that Christian missionaries were almost certainly at work in Munster as
early as the third century this contention is ridiculous. It is noteworthy,
however, that even this critic seems to believe in the antiquity of the Ogam
characters. As to his main contention that the "Confession" is not the work
of Patrick, Jubainville writes, "Il ne m'a pas convaincu" (<i>Revue Celtique</i>,
vol. xiv. p. 215), and M. L. Duchesne, commenting on Zimmer's view of St.
Patrick's nebulousness, writes, "Contestir l'authenticité de la Confession
et de la lettre à Coroticus me semble très aventuré" (Ibid., vol. xv. p. 188),
and Thurneysen also entirely refuses his credence.</p></div>

him, though the Gauls tried to make him the equivalent of Hercules by
giving him the classical club and lion's skin, yet his attributes are perfectly

<h4>EARLY IRISH CIVILISATION</h4>


<p>It has been frequently assumed, especially by English writers,
that the pre-historic Irish, because of their remoteness from
the Continent, must have been ruder, wilder, and more uncivilised
than the inhabitants of Great Britain. But such an
assumption is&mdash;to say nothing of our literary remains&mdash;in no
way borne out by the results of archæological research. The
contrary rather appears to be the case, that in point of wealth,
artistic feeling, and workmanship, the Irish of the Bronze Age
surpassed the inhabitants of Great Britain.</p>

<p>When we read such accounts as that, for example, in the
Book of Ballymote, of Cormac mac Art, taking his seat at the
assembly in Tara, all covered with gold and jewels, we must
not set it down to the perfervid imagination of the chronicler
without first consulting what Irish archæology has to say
upon the point. The appearance of Cormac (king of Ireland
in the third century, and perhaps greatest of pre-Christian
monarchs), is thus described. "Beautiful," says the writer,
quoting probably from ancient accounts now lost, "was the
appearance of Cormac in that assembly, flowing and slightly
curling was his golden hair. A red buckler with stars and
animals of gold and fastenings of silver upon him. A crimson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
cloak in wide descending folds around him, fastened at his
neck with precious stones. A torque of gold around his
neck. A white shirt with a full collar, and intertwined with
red gold thread upon him. A girdle of gold, inlaid with
precious stones, was around him. Two wonderful shoes of
gold, with golden loops upon his feet. Two spears with
golden sockets in his hands, with many rivets of red bronze.
And he was himself, besides, symmetrical and beautiful of form,
without blemish or reproach." The abundance of gold ornament
which Cormac is here represented as wearing, is no
mere imagination of the writer's. It is founded upon the
undoubted fact that of all countries in the West of Europe
Ireland was pre-eminent for its wealth in gold. How much
wealthier was Ireland than Great Britain may be imagined
from the fact that while the collection in the British Museum
of pre-historic gold from England, Scotland, and Wales
together amounted a couple of years ago to some three dozen
ounces, that in the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin weighs five
hundred and seventy ounces. And yet the collection in the
Academy contains only a small part of the gold-finds made in
Ireland, for before 1861, when the new law about treasure-trove
came into force, great numbers of gold objects are known
to have been sold to the goldsmiths and melted down. The
wealth of Ireland in gold&mdash;some of it found and smelted in the
Wicklow mountains<a name="FNanchor_1_202" id="FNanchor_1_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_202" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;must have at an early period determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
continental trade in its direction, and we have seen that
Tacitus reported its harbours as being better known through
trade than those of Great Britain, or, on the most unfavourable
reading of the passage, as being "known by commerce
and merchants."<a name="FNanchor_2_203" id="FNanchor_2_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_203" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This is also borne out by archæologists.
Professor Montelius, who has traced a close connection in
pre-historic times between Scandinavia and the West of
Europe,<a name="FNanchor_3_204" id="FNanchor_3_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_204" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> regards much of the pre-historic gold found in the
northern countries as Irish. Speaking of certain gold ornaments
found in Fünen, which show, according to him, marked
Irish influence, he writes: "Gold ornaments like these have
not been discovered elsewhere in Scandinavia, while a great
number of similar ornaments have been found in the British
Isles, especially in Ireland, whose wealth of gold in the Bronze
Age is amazing." Again he writes, "As certain of the gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
objects found in Denmark have been introduced demonstrably
from the British Islands, probably from Ireland, the thought
is obvious&mdash;is not a great part of the other gold objects found
in Southern Scandinavia also of Irish origin, and of the
Bronze Age there?... for this island [Ireland] was, during
the Bronze Age, one of the lands of Europe richest in gold."
"No other country in Europe possesses so much manufactured
gold belonging to early and mediæval times," writes Mr.
Ernest Smith.<a name="FNanchor_4_205" id="FNanchor_4_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_205" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It is true that the Irish Celts, despite their mineral wealth,
never minted coin, a want which has been adduced to prove
a lack of civilisation on their part. But, as Mr. Coffey points
out, coinage is a comparatively late invention; the Egyptians&mdash;for
all their civilisation&mdash;never possessed a native coinage,
and even such ancient trading cities as Carthage and Gades did
not strike coins until a late period. "A little reflection," says
Professor Ridgeway, "shows us that it has been quite possible
for peoples to attain a high degree of civilisation without
feeling any need of what are properly termed coins." "The
absence of coinage," adds Mr. Coffey, "does not necessarily
imply the absence of a currency system, and Professor Ridgeway
has shown that the ancient Irish possessed a system of
of currency or values, and a standard of weights."</p>

<p>A most interesting paper by Mr. Johnson, a Dublin
jeweller, recently read before the Royal Irish Academy,<a name="FNanchor_5_206" id="FNanchor_5_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_206" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
shown with the authority due to an expert, the marvellous
skill with which the pre-historic Irish worked their gold, and
the wealth of proper appliances which they must have possessed
in order to turn out such unique and admirable results.<a name="FNanchor_6_207" id="FNanchor_6_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_207" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The workmanship of Irish bronze articles is also very fine,
and fully equal to that of Britain, while Greenwell considers
their clay urns and food-vessels superior to the British. In
Ireland he says the urns, "and especially the food vessels, are
of better workmanship, and more elaborately and tastefully
ornamented than in most parts of Britain. Many of the food
vessels found in Argyleshire, and in other districts in the Southwest
of Scotland, as might be perhaps expected, are very
Irish in character, and may claim to be equally fine in taste
and delicate in workmanship with those of Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_7_208" id="FNanchor_7_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_208" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The brilliant appearance of Cormac mac Art when presiding
over the assembly at Tara, covered with gold and jewels,
receives enhanced credibility from the proofs of early Irish
wealth and culture that I have just adduced. Let us glance
at Tara itself, as it existed in the time of Cormac, and see
whether archæology can throw any light upon the ancient
accounts of that royal hill. It was round this hill that the
great Féis, or assemblage of the men of all Ireland, took place
triennially,<a name="FNanchor_8_209" id="FNanchor_8_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_209" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> with a threefold purpose&mdash;to promulgate laws
universally binding upon all Ireland; to test, purge, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
sanction the annals and genealogies of Ireland, in the presence
of all men, so that no untruth or flaw might creep in; and,
finally, to register the same in the great national record, in
later times called the Saltair of Tara, so that cases of disputed
succession might be peacefully settled by reference to this
central authoritative volume. The session of the men of
Ireland thus convened took place on the third day before
Samhain&mdash;November day&mdash;and ended the third day after it.
We are told that Cormac, who presided over these assemblies,<a name="FNanchor_9_210" id="FNanchor_9_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_210" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
had ten persons in constant waiting upon his person, who hardly
ever left him. These were a prince of noble blood, a druid,
a physician, a brehon, a bard, a historian, a musician, and three
stewards. And Keating tells us that the very same arrangement
was observed from Cormac's time&mdash;in the third century&mdash;to
the death of Brian Boru in the eleventh, the only alteration
being that a Christian priest was substituted for the druid.</p>

<p>To accommodate the chiefs and princes who came to the
great Féis, Cormac built the renowned Teach Míodhchuarta
[Toch Mee-coo-ar-ta] which was able to accommodate a
thousand persons, and which was used at once for a house of
assembly, a banqueting hall, and a sleeping abode. We have
two accounts of this hall and of the other monuments of Tara,
written, the one in poetry, the other in verse, some nine
hundred years ago. The prose of the Dinnseanchus describes
accurately the lie of the building, "to the north-west of the
eastern mound." "The ruins of this house"&mdash;it lay in ruins
then as now&mdash;"are thus situated: the lower part to the north
and the higher part to the south; and walls are raised about it
to the east and to the west. The northern side of it is
enclosed and small, the lie of it is north and south. It is in
the form of a long house with twelve doors upon it, or
fourteen, seven to the west and seven to the east. This was
the great house of a thousand soldiers."<a name="FNanchor_10_211" id="FNanchor_10_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_211" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Keating, following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
his ancient authorities, graphically describes the Tara
assembly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The nobles," he writes, "both territorial lords and captains of
bands of warriors, were each man of them, always attended by his
own proper shield-bearer. Again their banquet-halls were arranged
in the following manner, to wit, they were long narrow buildings
with tables arranged along both the opposite walls of the hall; then
along these side walls there was placed a beam, in which were fixed
numerous hooks (one over the seat destined for each of the nobles),
and between every two of them there was but the breadth of
one shield. Upon these hooks the shanachy hung up the shields
of the nobles previously to their sitting down to the banquet, at
which they all, both lords and captains, sat each beneath his own
shield. However, the most honoured side of the house was
occupied by the territorial lords, whilst the captains of warriors<a name="FNanchor_11_212" id="FNanchor_11_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_212" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
were seated opposite to them at the other. The upper end of the
hall was the place of the ollavs, while the lower end was assigned to
the attendants and the officers in waiting. It was also prescribed
that no man should be placed opposite another at the same table,
but that all, both territorial lords and captains, should sit with their
backs towards the wall, beneath their own shields. Again, they
never admitted females into their banquet-halls; these had a hall of
their own in which they were separately served. It was likewise the
prescribed usage to clear out the banquet-hall previous to serving
the assembled nobles therein. And no one was allowed to remain
in the building but three, namely, a Shanachy and a <i>bolsgaire</i> [marshal
or herald], and a trumpeter, the duty of which latter officer was
to summon all the guests to the banquet-hall by the sound of his
trumpet-horn. He had to sound his horn three times. At the first
blast the shield-bearers of the territorial chieftains assembled round
the door of the hall, where the marshal received from them the
shields of their lords, which he then, according to the directions of
the shanachy, hung up each in its assigned place. The trumpeter
then sounded his trumpet a second time, and the shield-bearers of
the chieftains of the military bands assembled round the door of the
banquet-hall, where the marshal received their lords' shields from
them also, and hung them up at the other side of the hall according
to the orders of the shanachy, and over the table of the warriors.
The trumpeter sounded his trumpet the third time, and thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
both the nobles and the warrior chiefs entered the banquet-hall, and
then each man sat down beneath his own shield, and thus were all
contests for precedency avoided amongst them."</p></blockquote>

<p>These accounts of the Dinnseanchus and of Keating, taken
from authorities now lost, will be likely to receive additional
credit when we know that the statements made nine hundred
years ago, when Tara had even then lain in ruins for four
centuries, have been verified in every essential particular by
the officers of the Ordnance Survey. The statement in the
Dinnseanchus made nearly nine hundred years ago that there
were either six or seven doors on each side, shows the condition
into which Tara had then fallen, one on each side being so
obliterated that now, also, it is difficult to say whether it was a
door or not. The length of the hall, according to Petrie's
accurate measurements, was <i>seven hundred and sixty feet</i>, and
its breadth was nearly ninety. There was a double row of
benches on each side, running the entire length of the hall,
which would give four rows of men if we remember that the
guests were all seated on the same side of the tables, and
allowing the ample room of three feet to each man, this would
just give accommodation to a thousand. In the middle of the
hall, running down all the way between the benches, there
was a row of fires, and just above each fire was a spit
descending from the roof, at which the joints were roasted.
There is a ground plan of the building, in the Book of Leinster,
and the figure of a cook is rudely drawn with his mouth open,
and a ladle in his hand to baste the joint. The king sat at
the southern end of the hall, and the servants and retainers
occupied the northern.</p>

<p>The banqueting-hall and all the other buildings at Tara
were of wood, nor is the absence of stone buildings in itself
a proof of low civilisation, since, in a country like Ireland,
abounding in timber, wood could be made to answer every
purpose&mdash;as in point of fact it does at this day over the greater
part of America, and in all northern countries where forests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
are numerous.<a name="FNanchor_12_213" id="FNanchor_12_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_213" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> All or most Irish houses, down to the period
of the Danish invasions, were constructed of wood, or of wood
and clay mixed, or of clay and unmortared stones, and their
strongholds were of wooden pallisades planted upon clay earth-works.
This is the reason why so few remains of pre-historic
buildings have come down to us, but it is no reason for believing
that, as in Cormac's banquet-hall, rude palatial effects were not
often produced. An interesting poem in the Dialogue of the
Sages, from the Book of Lismore, describes the house of the
Lady Credé, said to have been a contemporary of Finn mac
Cúmhail in the third century.<a name="FNanchor_13_214" id="FNanchor_13_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_214" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Though the poem may not
itself be very old, it no doubt embodies many ancient truths,
and is worth quoting from. A poet comes to woo the lady, and
brings this poem with him. Finn accompanies him. When they
reached her fortress "girls, yellow-haired, of marriageable age,
showed on the balconies of her bowers." The poet sang to her&mdash;</p>

<p>The houses of the ancient Irish were either like Cormac's
banqueting-hall and Credé's house, built quadrilaterally of
felled trees or split planks planted upright in the earth, and
thatched overhead, or else, as was most usually the case, they
were cylindrical and made of wickerwork, with a cup-shaped
roof, plastered with clay and whitewashed. The magnificent
dimensions of Cormac's palace, verified as they are by the
careful measurements of the Ordnance Survey&mdash;a palace
certainly erected in pagan times, since Tara was deserted for
ever about the year 550&mdash;bear evidence, like our wealth of
beautifully-wrought gold ornaments, and the superior workmanship
of our surviving articles of bronze and clay, to a high
degree of civilisation and culture amongst the pre-Christian
Irish; I have here adduced them as bearing indirect evidence
in favour of the probability that a people so civilised would
have been likely to have seized on the invention of writing
when they first came in contact with it, and would have kept
their annals and genealogies all the more accurately from the
very fact that they were evidently so advanced in other
matters.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_202" id="Footnote_1_202"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_202"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In the Irish Annals gold is said to have been first smelted in Leinster.
As late as the last century native gold was discovered on the confines of
Wicklow and Wexford, and nuggets of 22, 18, 9, and 7 ounces are
recorded as having been found there. Mr. Coffey quotes a most interesting
account by a Mr. Weaver, director of the works established there by the Irish
Government before the Union to look for gold. "The discovery of native
gold in Ballinvally stream, at Croghan Kinshella," says Mr. Weaver, "was
at first kept secret, but being divulged, almost the whole population of the
immediate neighbourhood flocked in to gather so rich a harvest, actually
neglecting at the time the produce of their own fields. This happened about
the autumn of the year 1796, when several hundreds of people might be
seen daily assembled digging and searching for gold in the banks and bed
of the stream. Considerable quantities were thus collected; this being as
it subsequently proved the most productive spot; and the populace
remained in undisturbed possession of the place for nearly six weeks,
when Government determined to commence active operations....
Regular stream works were soon established, and up to the unhappy time
of the rebellion in May, 1798, when the works were destroyed, Government
had been fully reimbursed its advances; the produce of the undertaking
having defrayed its own expenses and left a surplus in hand." The total
amount of gold collected from this place in the last hundred years is
valued at about £30,000. This particular spot had been probably overlooked,
as Mr. Coffey remarks, by the searchers of earlier days, but no doubt other
auriferous streams in the Wicklow mountains had given up their gold
long since in pre-historic times to the ancient workers. (<i>See</i> Coffey's
"Origins of Pre-historic Ornament in Ireland," p. 40.) Dr. Frazer, on the
other hand, does not believe that any great part of the gold found in
Ireland is indigenous, and talks of Spain and South Russia, and gold
plundered from Britain. But if this be the case, what an enormous pre-historic
trade Ireland must have carried on, or what a powerful invader
she must have been to come by such quantities of gold! (<i>See</i> Dr. Frazer's
paper in R.I.A. Proceedings, May, 1896). He has since supplemented
this by another in the Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries in
which he leans to the opinion that the Roman <i>aurei</i>, the coins plundered
from the Britons, were the real source of Irish gold.</p></div>

<h4>ST. PATRICK AND THE EARLY MISSIONARIES</h4>


<p>Even supposing the Ogam alphabet to have been used in
pre-Christian times, though it may have been employed by
ollavs and poets to perpetuate tribal names and genealogies,
still it was much too cumbrous and clumsy an invention to
produce anything deserving the name of real literature. It is,
so far as we know, only with the coming of Patrick that
Ireland may be said to have become, properly speaking, a
literary country. The churches and monasteries established
by him soon became so many nuclei of learning, and from
the end of the fifth century a knowledge of letters seems to
have entirely permeated the island. So suddenly does this
appear to have taken place, and so rapidly does Ireland seem
to have produced a flourishing literature of laws, poems, and
sagas, that it is very hard to believe that the inhabitants
had not, before his coming, arrived at a high state of
indigenous culture. This aspect of the case has been
recently strongly put by Dr. Sigerson. "I assert," said
he, speaking of the early Brehon laws, at the revision of
which in a Christian sense St. Patrick is said to have
assisted, "that, speaking biologically, such laws could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
emanate from any race whose brains have not been subject to
the quickening influence of education for many generations."<a name="FNanchor_1_217" id="FNanchor_1_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_217" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The usual date assigned for St. Patrick's landing in Ireland
in the character of a missionary is 432, and his work among
the Irish is said to have lasted for sixty years, during which
time he broke down the idol Crom Cruach, burnt the
books of the druids at Tara, ordained numerous missionaries
and bishops, and succeeded in winning over to Christianity
a great number of the chiefs and sub-kings, who were in their
turn followed by their tribesmen.</p>

<p>St. Patrick did not work alone, nor did he come to Ireland
as a solitary pioneer of a new religion; he was accompanied,
as we learn from his life in the Book of Armagh, by a
multitude of bishops, priests, deacons, readers, and others,<a name="FNanchor_2_218" id="FNanchor_2_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_218" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
who had crossed over along with him for the service. Several
were his own blood relations, one was his sister's son. Many
likely youths whom he met on his missionary travels he converted
to Christianity, taught to read, tonsured, and afterwards
ordained. These new priests thus appointed worked in all
directions, establishing churches and getting together congregations
from amongst the neighbouring heathen. Unable to
give proper attention to the teaching of the youths whom he
elected as his helpers, so long as he himself was engaged in
journeying through Ireland from point to point, he, after about
twenty years of peripatetic teaching, established at Armagh
about the year 450 the first Christian school ever founded in
Ireland, the progenitor of that long line of colleges which made
Ireland famous throughout Europe, and to which, two hundred
years later, her Anglo-Saxon neighbours flocked in thousands.<a name="FNanchor_3_219" id="FNanchor_3_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_219" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>The equipments of these newly-made priests was of the
scantiest. Each, as he was sent forth, received an alphabet-of-the-faith
or elementary-explanation of the Christian doctrine,
frequently written by Patrick himself, a "Liber ordinis,"
or "Mass Book," a written form for the administration of
the sacraments, a psaltery, and, if it could be spared, a copy of
the Gospels.<a name="FNanchor_4_220" id="FNanchor_4_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_220" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A good-sized retinue followed Patrick in all his
journeyings, ready to supply with their own hands all things
necessary for the new churches established by the saint, as
well as to minister to his own wants. He travelled with his
episcopal coadjutor, his psalm-singer, his assistant priest, his
judge&mdash;originally a Brehon by profession, whom he found most
useful in adjudicating on disputed questions&mdash;a personal champion
to protect him from sudden attack and to carry him
through floods and other obstacles, an attendant on himself,
a bellringer, a cook, a brewer, a chaplain at the table, two
waiters, and others who provided food and accommodation for
himself and his household. He had in his company three
smiths, three artificers, and three ladies who embroidered.
His smiths and artificers made altars, book-covers, bells, and
helped to erect his wooden churches; the ladies, one of them
his own sister, made vestments and altar linens.<a name="FNanchor_5_221" id="FNanchor_5_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_221" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>St. Patrick was essentially a man of work and not of letters,
and yet it so happens that he is the earliest Irish writer of
whom we can say with confidence that what is ascribed to him
is really his. And here it is as well to say something about
the genuineness of St. Patrick's personality and the authenticity
of his writings, for the opinion started by Ledwich has
gone abroad, and has somehow become prevalent, that St.
Patrick's personality is nearly as nebulous as that of King
Arthur or of Finn mac Cúmhail, and at the best is made up of
a number of little Patricks lumped into one great one. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
there was more than one Patrick<a name="FNanchor_6_222" id="FNanchor_6_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_222" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> is certain,<a name="FNanchor_7_223" id="FNanchor_7_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_223" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and that the
great Saint Patrick who wrote the "Confession" may have got
credit in the early Latin and later Irish lives for the acts of
others, is perfectly possible, but that most of the essential
features of his life are true, is beyond all doubt, and we
have a manuscript 1091 years old, apparently copied from
his own handwriting, and containing his own confession and
apologia.</p>

<p>How this exquisite manuscript, consisting of 216 vellum
leaves, written in double columns, has happily been preserved
to us, we shall not lose time in inquiring; but how its exact
date has been ascertained through what Dr. Reeves has characterised
as "one of the most elegant and recondite demonstrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
which any learned society has on record, is worth mentioning."
The Rev. Charles Graves, the present Bishop of Limerick,
made a thorough examination of the whole codex when, after
many vicissitudes and hair-breadth escapes from destruction, it
had been temporarily deposited in the Royal Irish Academy.
Knowing, as O'Curry pointed out, that it was the custom for
Irish scribes to sign their own names, with usually some particulars
about their writing, at the end of each piece they
copied, he made a careful search and discovered that this
had actually been done in the Book of Armagh, and in
no less than eight places, but that on every spot where it
occurred it had been erased for some apparently inscrutable
reason, with the greatest pains. In the last place but one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
however, where the colophon occurred, the process of erasure
had been less thorough than in the others, and after long consideration,
and treatment of the erasure with gallic acid and
spirits of wine, Dr. Graves discovered that the words so carefully
rubbed out were <i>Pro Ferdomnacho ores</i>, "Pray for Ferdomnach."
Turning to the other places, he found that the
erased words in at least one other place were evidently the
same. This settled the name of the scribe; he was Ferdomnach.
The next step was to search the "Four Masters," who
record the existence of two scribes of that name who died at
Armagh, one in 726 and the other in 844. One of these it
must have been who wrote the Book of Armagh,&mdash;but
which? This also Dr. Graves discovered, with the greatest
ingenuity. At the foot of Fols. 52-6 he was, with extreme
difficulty, able to decipher the words <i> ... ach hunc ...
e dictante ... ach herede Patricii scripsit</i>. From these stray
syllables he surmised that Ferdomnach had written the book
at the bidding of some Archbishop of Armagh whose name
ended in <i>ach</i>. For this the Psalter of Cashel, Leabhar Breac,
and "Four Masters," were consulted, and it was found that
one Archbishop Senaach died in 609; it could not then have
been by his commands the book was written by the first
Ferdomnach; then came, after a long interval, Faoindealach,
who died in 794, Connmach, who died in 806,
and Torbach, who held the primacy for one year after
him. On examining the hiatus it was found that the
letter which preceded the fragment <i>ach</i> could not have been
either an <i>l</i> or an <i>m</i>, but might have been a <i>b</i>, thus putting out
of the question the names of Connmach and Faoindealach.
Besides the vacant space before the <i>ach</i> was just sufficient to
admit of the letters <i>Tor</i>, but not <i>Conn</i>, much less <i>Faoindea</i>.
The conclusion was obvious: the passage ran, <i>Ferdomnach
hunc librum e dictante Torbach herede Patricii scripsit</i>, "Ferdomnach
wrote this book at the dictation (or command) of
Torbach, Patrick's heir (successor)." Torbach, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
seen, became Archbishop in 806 and died in 807. The date
was in this way recovered.<a name="FNanchor_8_224" id="FNanchor_8_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_224" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>I have been thus particular in tracing the steps by which
the age of this manuscript came to light, because it contains the
earliest piece of certain Irish literature we have, the "Confession
of St. Patrick." Now the usually accepted date of St. Patrick's
death, as given in the Annals of Ulster, is 492, about three hundred
years before that, and Ferdomnach, the scribe, after copying it,
added these words: "<i>Huc usque volumen quod patricius manu
conscripsit sua. Septimadecima martii die translatus est patricius ad
cælos," i.e.</i>, "thus far the volume which Patrick wrote with his own
hand. On the seventeenth day of March was Patrick translated
to the heavens." It would appear highly probable from this
that Ferdomnach actually copied from St. Patrick's autograph,<a name="FNanchor_9_225" id="FNanchor_9_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_225" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
which had become so defaced or faded during the three previous
centuries, that the scribe has written in many places <i>incertus
liber hic</i>, "the book is uncertain here," or else put a note<a name="FNanchor_10_226" id="FNanchor_10_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_226" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
interrogation to indicate that he was not sure whether he had
copied the text correctly. It will be seen from this that there
was not the slightest trace of any concealment on the part of
the scribe as to who he himself was, or what he was copying;
there was no attempt to antedate his own writing, or to
suggest that his copy was an original. But long after the
scribe's generation had passed away and the origin of his work
been forgotten, the volume which at first had been regarded
only as a fine transcript of early documents, became known as
"Canon Phádraig," or Patrick's Testament, and popular
opinion, relying on the colophon "thus far the book which
Patrick wrote with his own hand," set down the work as the
saint's autograph. The belief that the volume was St.
Patrick's own autograph of course enhanced enormously its
value, and with it the dignity of its possessors, and the
unscrupulous plan was resolved on of erasing the signature of
the actual scribe. The veneration of the public was thus
secured by interested persons at the cost of truth, and the
deception probably lasted so long as the possession of such
a volume brought with it either credit or dignity. This same
volume<a name="FNanchor_11_227" id="FNanchor_11_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_227" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> has another interest attaching to it, so that we
cannot but felicitate ourselves that out of the wreck of so
many thousands of volumes, it has been spared to us&mdash;it was
brought to Brian Boru, when in the year 1004 he went upon
his royal progress through Ireland, the first man of the race
of Eber who had attained the proud position of monarch
or Ard-righ for many centuries, and he, by the hand of
his secretary, made an entry which may still be seen to-day,
confirming the primacy of Armagh, and re-granting to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the episcopal supremacy of Ireland which it had always
enjoyed.<a name="FNanchor_12_228" id="FNanchor_12_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_228" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>It is now time to glance at St. Patrick's "Confession," as it
is usually called, though in reality it is much more of the
nature of an apologia <i>pro vita sua</i>. The evidence in favour of
its authenticity is overwhelming, and is accepted by such
cautious scholars as Stokes,<a name="FNanchor_13_229" id="FNanchor_13_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_229" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Todd, and Reeves, no first-rate
critic, with perhaps one exception, having so far as I know
ever ventured to question its genuineness. It is impossible to
assign any motive for a forgery, and casual references to
Decuriones, Slave-traffic, and to the "Brittaniæ," or Britains,
bear testimony to its antiquity. Again, the Latin in which it
is written is barbarous in the extreme, the periods are rude,
sometimes ungrammatical, often nearly unintelligible. He
begins by telling us that his object in writing this confession
in his old age was to defend himself from the charge of
presumptuousness in undertaking the work he tried to perform
amongst the Irish. He tells us that he had many toils and
perils to surmount, and much to endure while engaged upon
it. He never received one farthing for all his preaching and
teaching. The people indeed were generous, and offered
many gifts, and cast precious things upon the altar, but he
would not receive them lest he might afford the unrighteous
an occasion to cavil. He was still encompassed about with
dangers, but he heeded them not, looking to the success which
had attended his efforts, how "the sons of the Scots and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
daughters of their princes became monks and virgins of Christ,"
and "the number of holy widows and of continent maidens was
countless." It would be tedious were he to recount even a
portion of what he had gone through. Twelve times had his
life been endangered, but God had rescued him, and brought
him safe from all plots and ambuscades and rewarded him for
leaving his parents, and friends, and country, heeding neither
their prayers nor their tears, that he might preach the gospel
in Ireland. He appeals to all he had converted, and to all who
knew him, to say whether he had not refused all gifts&mdash;nay, it
was he himself who gave the gifts, to the kings and to their
sons, and oftentimes was he robbed and plundered of everything,
and once had he been bound in fetters of iron for fourteen days
until God had delivered him, and even still while writing this
confession he was living in poverty and misery, expecting
death or slavery, or other evil. He prays earnestly for one
thing only, that he may persevere, and not lose the people
whom God has given to him at the very extremity of the
world.</p>

<p>Unhappily this "Confession" is a most unsatisfying composition,
for it omits to mention almost everything of most interest
relating to the saint himself and to his mission. What floods
of light might it have thrown upon a score of vexed questions,
how it might have set at rest for ever theories on druidism,
kingship, social life, his own birthplace, his mission from Rome,<a name="FNanchor_14_230" id="FNanchor_14_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_230" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
his captors. Even of himself he tells us next to nothing,
except that his father's name was Calpornus,<a name="FNanchor_15_231" id="FNanchor_15_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_231" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Potitus, the son of Odissus, a priest, and that he dwelt in the
<i>vicus</i> or township of Benaven Taberniæ; he had also a small
villa not far off, where he tells us he was made captive at
the age of about sixteen years. Because his Christian training
was bad, and he was not obedient to the priests when they
admonished him to seek for salvation, therefore God punished
him, and brought him into captivity in a strange land at the
end of the world. When he was brought to Ireland he tells
us that his daily task was to feed cattle, and then the love of
God entered into his heart, and he used to rise before the sun
and pray in the woods and mountains, in the rain, the hail, and
the snow. Then there came to him one night a voice in his
sleep saying to him "Your ship is ready," and he departed and
went for two hundred miles, until he reached a port where
he knew no one. This was after six years' captivity. The
master of the ship would not take him on board, but afterwards
he relented just as Patrick was about to return to the cottage
where he had got lodging. He succeeded at last in reaching
the home of his parents <i>in Britannis</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, in some part of
Britain, including Scotland], and his parents besought him,
now that he had returned from so many perils, to remain with
them always. But the angel Victor came in the guise of a
man from Ireland, and gave him a letter, in which the voice of
the Irish called him away, and the voices of those who dwelt
near the wood of Focluth called him to walk amongst them,
and the spirit of God, too, urged him to return.<a name="FNanchor_16_232" id="FNanchor_16_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_232" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>He says nothing of his training, or his ordination, or his long
sojourn in Gaul, or of St. Germanus, with whom he studied
according to the "Lives," but he alludes incidentally to his
wish to see his parents and his native Britain, and to revisit the
brethren in Gaul, and to see the face of God's saints there; but
though he desired all this, he would not leave his beloved
converts, but would spend the rest of his life amongst them.<a name="FNanchor_17_233" id="FNanchor_17_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_233" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>From this brief <i>résumé</i> of the celebrated "Confession" it will
be seen that it is the perfervid outpouring of a zealous early
Christian, anxious only to clear himself from the charges of
worldliness or carelessness, and absolutely devoid of those
appeals to general interest which we meet with in most of
such memoirs, but there is a vein of warm piety running
through the whole, and an abundance of scriptural quotations&mdash;all,
of course, from the ante-Hieronymian or pre-Vulgate
version, another proof of antiquity&mdash;which has caused it to be
remarked that a forger might, perhaps, write equally bad Latin,
but could hardly "forge the spirit that breathes in the language
which is the manifest outpourings of a heart like unto the
heart of St. Paul."<a name="FNanchor_18_234" id="FNanchor_18_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_234" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>There are two other pieces of literature assigned to St.
Patrick, as well as the "Confession"; these are the "Epistle to
Coroticus" in Latin, and the "Deer's Cry" in Irish. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Epistle is not found in the Book of Armagh, but it is found
in other MSS. as old as the tenth or eleventh century, and
bears such close resemblance in style and language to the
"Confession," whole phrases actually occurring in both, that it
also has generally been regarded as genuine.<a name="FNanchor_19_235" id="FNanchor_19_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_235" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> There is some
doubt as to who Coroticus was, but he seems to have been a
semi-Christian king of Dumbarton who, along with some Scots,
<i>i.e.</i>, Irish, and the Southern Picts who had fallen away from
Christianity, raided the eastern shores of Ireland and carried
off a number of St. Patrick's newly-converted Christians,
leaving the white garments of the neophytes stained with
blood, and hurrying into captivity numbers upon whose foreheads
the holy oil of confirmation was still glistening. The
first letter was to ask Coroticus to restore the captives, and
when this request was derided the next was sent, excommunicating
him and all his aiders and abettors, calling upon all
Christians neither to eat nor drink in their company until
they had made expiation for their crimes. Patrick himself
had, he here explains, preached the gospel to the Irish nation
for the sake of God, though they had made him a captive and
destroyed the men-servants and maids of his father's house.
He had been born a freedman and a noble, the son of a
decurio or prefect, but he had sold his nobility for others and
regretted it not. His lament over the loss of his converts is
touching: "Oh! my most beautiful and most loving brothers
and children whom in countless numbers I have begotten in
Christ, what shall I do for you? Am I so unworthy before
God and men that I cannot help you? Is it a crime to have
been born in Ireland?<a name="FNanchor_20_236" id="FNanchor_20_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_236" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> And have we not the same God as
they have? I sorrow for you, yet I rejoice, for if ye are taken
from the world ye are believers through me, and are gone to
Paradise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Cry of the Deer," or "Lorica," as it is also called, is in
Irish. The saint is said to have made it when on his way to
visit King Laoghaire [Leary] at Tara, and the assassins who
had been planted by the king to slay him and his companions
thought as he chanted this hymn that it was a herd of deer
that passed them by, and thus they escaped. The metre of
the original is a kind of unrhymed or half-rhymed rhapsody,
called in Irish a <i>Rosg</i>, and is perfectly unadorned. The
language, however, though very old, has of course been
modified in the process of transcription. Patrick calls upon
the Trinity to protect him that day at Tara, and to bind to
him the power of the elements.</p>

<p>In the Book of Armagh, in the last chapter of Tirechan's
life, St. Patrick is declared to be entitled to four honours in
every church and monastery of the island. One of these
honours was that the hymn written by St. Seachnall, his
nephew, in praise of himself, was to be sung in the churches
during the days when his festival was being celebrated, and
another was that "his Irish canticle" was to be always sung,<a name="FNanchor_23_239" id="FNanchor_23_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_239" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
apparently all the year through, in the liturgy, but perhaps only
during the week of his festival. The Irish canticle is evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
this "Lorica," which was, as we see from this notice in the
Book of Armagh, believed to be his in the seventh century,
and it has been sung under that belief from that day almost to
our own.<a name="FNanchor_24_240" id="FNanchor_24_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_240" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The other hymn, the singing of which at his festival is
alluded to as one of St. Patrick's "honours," was composed
by Seachnall [Shaughnal],<a name="FNanchor_25_241" id="FNanchor_25_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_241" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> a nephew of St. Patrick's, in laudation
of the saint himself. It is a very interesting piece of
rough latinity, and is generally regarded as genuine. The
occasion of its composition deserves to be told, for it casts a
ray of light on the prudential and self-restrained side of St.
Patrick's character, which no doubt contributed largely to his
success when working in the midst of his wavering converts.
Seachnall said that Patrick's preaching would be perfect if he
only insisted a little more on the necessity of giving, for then
more property and land would be at the disposal of the Church
for pious uses. This remark of his nephew was repeated to
St. Patrick, who was very much annoyed at it, and said
beautifully, that "for the sake of charity he forbore to preach
charity," and intimated that the holy men who should come
after him might benefit by the offerings of the faithful which
he had left untouched. Then Seachnall, grieved at having
thus pained his uncle, and anxious to win his regard again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
composed a poem of twenty-two stanzas each beginning with a
different letter, with four lines of fifteen syllables in each verse.<a name="FNanchor_26_242" id="FNanchor_26_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_242" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
When he had done this he asked permission of Patrick to
recite to him a poem which he had composed in praise of a
holy man, and when Patrick said that he would gladly hear
the praises of any of God's household, the poet adroitly
suppressing Patrick's name which occurs in the first verse,
recited it for him. Patrick was pleased, but interupted the
poet at one stanza when he said that the subject of his laudations
was <i>maximus in regno cælorum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_243" id="FNanchor_27_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_243" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> "the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven," asking how could that be said of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
man. <i>Maximus</i>, ingeniously replied Seachnall, does not here
mean "greatest," but only "very great." He then disclosed to
his uncle that he himself was the object of the poem, and
asked&mdash;like all bards&mdash;for the reward for it, whereupon Patrick
promised that to all who recited the hymn piously morning
and evening, God in His mercy might give the glory of
heaven. "I am content with that award," said the poet, "but
as the hymn is long and difficult to be remembered I wish you
would obtain the same reward for whosoever recites even a part
of it." Whereupon St. Patrick promised that the recitation
of the last three verses would be sufficient, and his nephew
was satisfied, having proved himself the first poet of Christian
Ireland, and having obtained such a reward for his verses as
neither bard nor ollav had ever obtained before him. It was
probably this same Seachnall who was the author of the much
finer hymn of eleven verses which used to be sung in the old
Irish churches at communion&mdash;</p>

<p>The legend in the Leabhar Breac has it that this hymn was
first chanted during the holy communion by the angels in
his church, on the reconciliation between himself and Saint
Patrick, whence the origin of chanting it during the communion
service.</p>

<p>The Book of Armagh contains the two earliest lives of
the national saint that we have, probably the two earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
biographies of any size ever composed in Ireland. They are
written in rude Latin, with a good deal of Irish place-names
and Irish words intermixed, the first by one Muirchu Maccu
Machteni,<a name="FNanchor_28_244" id="FNanchor_28_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_244" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> who tells us that he wrote at the instigation of
Aed, bishop of Sletty, who, as we know from the "Four
Masters," died about 698, and the second by Tirechan, who
says he received his knowledge of the saint from the lips and
writings of Bishop Ultan,<a name="FNanchor_29_245" id="FNanchor_29_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_245" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> his tutor, who died in 656, and
who, supposing him to have been seventy or eighty years old
at the time of his death, must have been born only eighty or
ninety years after the death of St. Patrick himself. Both of
these writers appear to have had older memoirs to draw on,
for Muirchu says that many had before them endeavoured to
write the history of St. Patrick from what their fathers and
those who were ministers of the Word from the beginning
had told them, though none had ever succeeded in producing a
proper biography,<a name="FNanchor_30_246" id="FNanchor_30_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_246" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and in Tirechan's life of him in the Book
of Armagh&mdash;an evident patchwork&mdash;we read that all his
godly doings had been brought together<a name="FNanchor_31_247" id="FNanchor_31_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_247" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and collected by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
most skilful of the ancients. The first of these lives consists
of two books containing twenty-eight and thirteen short
chapters, respectively, the second, Tirechan's, of one book
containing fifty-seven chapters, in addition to which there are
a number of minor notes referring to St. Patrick in Latin and
in Irish, which Ferdomnach, who transcribed the book in 807,
appears to have taken from other old lives or memoirs of
the saint. The Irish portions of these notes are of peculiar
interest, as showing what the Irish language was, as written
about the year 800.<a name="FNanchor_32_248" id="FNanchor_32_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_248" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>If it is genuine the earliest life of Patrick ever written
would probably be the brief metrical life ascribed to Fiacc
of Sletty, the sixth or seventh in descent from Cáthaoir
[Cauheer] Mór, who was king of Leinster at the close of
the second century.<a name="FNanchor_33_249" id="FNanchor_33_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_249" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> His mother was a sister of Dubhthach's
[Duv-hach], the chief poet and Brehon of Ireland, who, we are
told, helped St. Patrick to review and revise the Brehon Laws.
Fiacc was a youthful poet in Dubhthach's train at Tara.
Afterwards he was tonsured by St. Patrick, became Bishop
of Sletty, and on Patrick's death is said to have written
his life, and not forgetful of his former training, to have
written it in elaborate verse.<a name="FNanchor_34_250" id="FNanchor_34_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_250" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> So famous a critic as Zimmer
believed half the poem to be genuine, but Thurneysen rejects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
it because it does not fall in with his theories of Irish
metre.<a name="FNanchor_35_251" id="FNanchor_35_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_251" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>But the longest and most important life of St. Patrick
is that known as the Tripartite, or Triply-divided Life,
which is really a series of three semi-historical homilies, or
discourses, which were probably delivered in honour of the
saint on the three festival days devoted to his memory, that is,
the Vigil, the Feast itself, on March 17th, and the day after,
or else the Octave. This Tripartite life, which is a fairly
complete one, is written in ancient Irish, with many passages
of Latin interspersed. The monk Jocelin, who wrote a life
of the saint in the twelfth century, tells us that St. Evin<a name="FNanchor_36_252" id="FNanchor_36_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_252" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>&mdash;from
whom Monasterevin, in Queen's County, is called,
a saint of the early sixth century&mdash;wrote a life of Patrick
partly in Latin and partly in Gaelic, and Colgan, the learned
Franciscan who translated the Tripartite in his "Trias
Thaumaturga,"<a name="FNanchor_37_253" id="FNanchor_37_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_253" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> believed that this was the very life which
St. Evin wrote. Colgan found the Tripartite life in three very
ancient Gaelic MSS., procured for him, no doubt, by the unwearied
research of Brother Michael O'Clery in the early part of
the seventeenth century, which he collated one with the other,
and of which he gives the following noteworthy account:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first thing to be observed is that it has been written by its
first author and in the aforesaid manuscript, partly in Latin, partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in Gaelic, and this in very ancient language, almost impenetrable
by reason of its very great antiquity, exhibiting not only in the same
chapter, but also in the same line, alternate phrases now in the Latin,
now in the Gaelic tongue. In the second place, it is to be noticed
that this life, on account of the very great antiquity of its style,
which was held in much regard, used to be read in the schools of
our antiquarians in the presence of their pupils, being elucidated
and expounded by the glosses of the masters, and by interpretations
of and observations on the more abstruse words; so that hence it
is not to be wondered at that some words&mdash;which certainly did
happen&mdash;gradually crept from these glosses into the texts, and thus
brought a certain colour of newness into this most ancient and
faithful author, some things being turned from Latin into Gaelic,
some abbreviated by the scribes, and some altogether omitted."</p></blockquote>

<p>Colgan further tells us that, "of the three MSS. above
mentioned, the first and chief is from very ancient vellums of
the O'Clerys, antiquarians in Ulster; the second from the
O'Deorans, of Leinster; the third taken from I know not
what codex; and they differ from each other in some respects;
one relating more diffusely what is more close in the others,
and one relating in Latin what in the others was told in
Gaelic; but we have followed the authority of that which
relates the occurrences more diffusely and in Latin." O'Curry
discovered in the British Museum a copy of this life, made in
the fifteenth century, and it has since been admirably edited by
Dr. Whitley Stokes, who, however, does not believe for philological
and other reasons, that it could have been written before
the middle of the tenth century. If so it is no doubt a
compilation of all the pre-existing lives of the saint, and it
mentions distinctly that six different writers, not counting
Fiacc the poet, had collected the events of St. Patrick's life
and his miracles, amongst whom were St. Columcille, who
died in 592, and St. Ultan, who died in 656.<a name="FNanchor_38_254" id="FNanchor_38_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_254" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> It is hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
necessary, however, to say that in the matter of all anonymous
Gaelic writings like the present, it is difficult to decide with
any certainty as to age or date. The occurrence, indeed, of
very old forms, shows that the sentences containing those old
forms were first written at an early period; the occurrence of
more modern forms, however, is no proof that the passages
containing them were first written in modern times, for the
words may have been altered by later transcribers into the
language they spoke themselves; nor are allusions to events
which we know were later than the date of an alleged writer,
<i>always</i> conclusive proofs that the work which contains them
cannot be his work, for such allusions constantly creep into
the margin of books at the hands of copyists, especially if those
books were&mdash;as Colgan says the Tripartite life was&mdash;annotated
and explained in schools. In cases of this kind there is always
considerable latitude to be allowed to destructive and constructive
criticism, and at the end matters must still remain
doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_39_255" id="FNanchor_39_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_255" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

that does not detract one iota from the genuineness of the life of the great
Colum, called Columcille. There were fourteen St. Brendans, there
were twenty-five St. Ciarans, and fifteen St. Brigits.

<p>
How Ledwich&mdash;who, however, as O'Donovan remarks, looks at everything
Irish with a jaundiced eye&mdash;could have written down St. Patrick
as a myth is inconceivable, in the face of the fact that he was already
recognised in the sixth century as a great saint. The earliest mention of
him is probably St. Columba's subscription to the Book of Durrow, in
the sixth century, which runs: "Rogo beatitudinem tuam Sancte Presbyter
Patrici, ut quicumque hunc libellum manu tenuerit Columbæ Scriptoris,
qui hoc scripsi ... met evangelium per xii. dierum spatium." Here we
see a prayer already addressed to him as a national saint.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_223" id="Footnote_7_223"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_223"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> This is clearly shown by the 56th chap. of Tirechan's life fol. 16aa
of the Book of Armagh, where he makes the following statement:
"XIII. Anno Teothosii imperatoris a Celestino episcopo papa Romæ
Patricius episcopus ad doctrinam Scottorum mittitur. Qui Celestinus
XLVII episcopus fuit a Petro apostolo in urbe Roma. Paladius episcopus
primus mittitur [in the year 430, according to Bede] qui Patricius alio
nomine appellabatur, qui martirium passus est apud Scottos, ut tradunt
sancti antiqui. Deinde Patricius secundus ab anguelo Dei, Victor nomine,
et a Celestino papa mittitur, cui Hibernia tota credidit, qui eam pene
totam bab[titzavit]." Also it is to be observed that St. Patrick's life
according to the usual computations, covers 120 years, which seems an
improbably long period. According to the Brussels Codex of Muirchu
Maccu Machteni's life, he died <i>a passione Domini nostri</i> 436; the author, no
doubt, imagined the passion to have taken place in A.D. 34; this would fix
Patrick's death as in 470. See p. 20 of Father Hogan's "Documenta
ex Libro Armachano," and with this Tirechan also agrees, saying
"A passione autem christi colleguntur anni ccccxxxvi. usque ad
mortem Patricii." Tirechan curiously contradicts himself in saying,
"Duobus autem vel v annis regnavit Loiguire post mortem Patricii, omnis
autem regni illius tempus xxxvi. ut putamus," in chap. ii., and in chap.
liii. he says that Patrick taught (<i>i.e.</i>, in Ireland) for 72 years! He
evidently compiled badly from two different documents.
</p>
<p>
The only cogent reason for doubting about the reality of St. Patrick is
that he is not mentioned in the Chronicon of Prosper, which comes down
to the year 455, and which ascribes the conversion of Ireland to Palladius,
as does Bede afterwards. It is the silence of Prosper and Bede about
any one of the name of Patrick which has cast doubt upon his existence.
A most ingenious theory has been propounded by Father E. O'Brien in
the "Irish Ecclesiastical Record" to explain this. According to him Patrick
<i>is</i> the Palladius of Prosper and Bede. The earliest lives, and the scholiast
on Fiacc's hymn, tell us that Patrick had four names; one of these was
Succat "<i>qui est deus belli</i>," but Palladius is the Latin of Patrick's name
(succat). The <i>Deus belli</i> could only be rendered into Latin by the words
Arius Martius or Palladius, these being the only names drawn from war-gods,
and of these Palladius was the commonest. It seems not unlikely
that the Patrick who wrote the "Confession" and converted Ireland is the
Palladius of Bede and Prosper, who also converted Ireland. The Paladius
of Tirechan who failed to convert Ireland is evidently another person
altogether.
</p>
<p>
It is to be remarked that although Bede never mentions Patrick in his
"Ecclesiastical History," nevertheless in the "Martyrology"&mdash;found by
Mabillon at Rheims, and attributed to Bede, Patrick is distinctly commemorated&mdash;

the codex beyond doubt or cavil, see Dr. Graves' paper read before the
Royal Irish Academy, vol. iii. pp. 316-324, and a supplementary paper
giving other cogent reasons, vol. iii. p. 358. According to O'Donovan, the
"Four Masters" antedate here by five years. It is worth remarking that
Torbach, who caused this copy to be made, was himself a noted scribe.
His death in 807 is recorded in the "Four Masters" and in the "Annals
of Ulster," we read "Torbach, son of Gorman, scribe, lector, and Abbot of
Armagh, died."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_9_225" id="Footnote_9_225"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_225"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> There are several passages omitted in the Book of Armagh, which
are found in an ancient Brussels MS. of the eleventh century. These were
probably omitted from the Book of Armagh because they were undecipherable.
The Brussels MS. and others contain nearly as much again as it,
and there are many proofs that this extra matter is not of later or spurious
origin; thus Tirechan refers to Patrick's own records, "<i>ut in scriptione sua
affirmat,</i>" for evidence of a fact not mentioned in the "Confession" as given
in the Book of Armagh, but which is supplied by the other MSS., namely, that
Patrick paid the price of fifteen "souls of men," or slaves, for protection
on his missionary journey across Ireland. The frequent occurrence of
<i>deest, et cetera, et reliqua</i>, show that the Armagh copy of the "Confession"
is nothing like a full one. The Brussels MS. formerly belonged to the
Irish monastery of Würzburg.</p></div>

ignores the Roman Mission. But while the life of Muirchu Maccu

book, distinctly acknowledges it, in these words, "deinde Patricius secundus

Calpornus being evidently taken as belonging to the Mac, thus Mac Calprainn
became Mac Alprainn. In the Brussels Codex of Muirchu Maccu
Machteni's life, however, he is called <i>Alforni filius</i>, and the place of his
birth is called <i>Ban navem thabur indecha</i>, supposed to be Killpatrick, near
Dumbarton, in Scotland, which is evidently a corruption of his own
Bannaven Taberniæ, which seems to mean River-head Tavern; it may be
from the two words <i>navem thabur</i> that St. Fiacc's hymn says that he was
born in <i>nemthur</i>. Patrick himself only gives us two generations of his
ancestry, and it is very significant of Irish ways to find Flann of
Monasterboice, running it up to fourteen!</p></div>

'Rogamus te sancte puer ut venias et adhuc ambulas inter nos.'
Et valde compunctus sum corde, et amplius non potui legere. Et sic

Scholars," p. 77, "the original is chanted by the peasantry of the south
and west in the ancestral tongue, and it is regarded as a strong shield
against all dangers natural or supernatural." I, myself, however, in
collecting the "Religious Songs of Connacht," have found no trace of this,
and I am not sure that the learned Bishop of Clonfert, led astray by
Petrie, is not here confounding it with the "Marainn Phadraig," which
mysterious piece is implicitly believed to be the work of St. Patrick,
and is still recited all over the west, with the belief that there is a peculiar
virtue attached to it. I have even known money to have been paid for its
recital in the west of Galway, as a preventive of evil. For this curious
piece, which is to me at least more than half unintelligible, see my
"Religious Songs of Connacht." It appears to have been founded upon
an incident similar to that recorded by Muirchu Maccu Machteni, book
i. chap. 26.</p></div>

it deserves some consideration. It is a sort of trochaic tetrameter catalectic,
of the very rudest type. The <i>ictus</i>, or stress of the voice, which is
supposed to fall on the first syllable of the first, third, fifth, and seventh
feet, seldom corresponds with the accent. The elision of "m" before a vowel
is disregarded, no quantities are observed, and the solitary rule of prosody
kept is that the second syllable of the seventh foot is always short, with
the exception of one word, <i>indutus</i>, which the poet probably pronounced
as <i>ind&#365;tus</i>. The third verse runs thus, with an evident effort at vowel
rhyme ("Liber Hymnorum," vol. i. p. 11).
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Beati Christi custodit mandata in omnibus</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cujus opera refulgent clara inter homines."</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Muratori printed this hymn, from the so-called Antiphonary of Bangor,
a MS. of the eight century preserved in the Ambrosian Library. The
rude metre is that employed by Hilary in his hymn beginning&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ymnum dicat turba fratrum, ymnum cantus personet,"</span><br />
</p>
<p>
which, as Stokes points out, is the same as that of the Roman soldiers,
preserved in Suetonius,
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Cæsar Gallias subégit, Nicomedes Cæsarem."</span><br />
</p>
<p>
The internal evidence of the antiquity of this hymn is "strong," says
Stokes, "first, the use of the present tense in describing the saint's actions;
secondly, the absence of all reference to the miracles with which the
Tripartite and other lives are crowded; and, thirdly, the absence of all
allusion to the Roman mission on which many later writers from Tirechan
downwards insist with much persistency." We may then, I think, receive
this hymn as authentic.</p></div>

<h4>ST. BRIGIT</h4>


<p>St. Brigit was&mdash;after St. Patrick himself&mdash;probably the most
noted figure amongst Irish Christians in the fifth century.
She must have attained her extraordinary influence through
sheer ability and intellectuality, for she appears to have been
the daughter of a slave-woman,<a name="FNanchor_1_256" id="FNanchor_1_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_256" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> employed in the mansion of
a chief called Dubhthach [Duv-hach, or Duffach], who was
himself tenth in descent from Felimidh, the lawgiver monarch
of Ireland in the second century. The king's wife, jealous of
her husband's liking for his slave, threatened him with these
words, "Unless thou sellest yon bondmaid in distant lands I
will exact my dowry from thee and I will leave thee," and so
had her driven from the place and sold to a druid, in whose
house her daughter, Dubhthach's offspring, soon afterwards saw
the light. She was thus born into slavery, though not quite
a slave; for Dubhthach, in selling the mother into slavery,
expressly reserved for himself her offspring, whatever it
might be. She must have been, at least, early inured to
hardship, as St. Patrick had been. The druid, however, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
not prevent her from being baptized. She grew up to be a
girl of exceeding beauty, and many suitors sought her in
marriage. She returned to her father's house, but refused all
offers of matrimony. She aroused the jealousy of her father's
wife, as her mother had done before her, and Dubhthach,
indignant at her unbounded generosity with his goods, decided
upon selling her to the king of North Leinster. Her father's
abortive attempt to get rid of her on this occasion is thus
quaintly described in her Irish life in the Leabhar Breac.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thereafter," says the life, "Dubhthach and his consort were
minded to sell the holy Brigit into bondage, for Dubhthach liked
not his cattle and his wealth to be dealt out to the poor, and that is
what Brigit used to do. So Dubhthach fared in his chariot and
Brigit along with him.</p>

<p>"Said Dubhthach to Brigit, 'Not for honour or reverence to thee
art thou carried in a chariot, but to take thee, to sell thee to grind
the quern for Dunlang mac Enda, King of Leinster.'</p>

<p>"When they came to the King's fortress Dubhthach went in to
the king, and Brigit remained in her chariot at the fortress door.
Dubhthach had left his sword in the chariot near Brigit. A leper
came to Brigit to ask an alms. She gave him Dubhthach's sword.</p>

<p>"Said Dubhthach to the King, 'Wilt thou buy a bondmaid,
namely, my daughter?' says he.</p>

<p>"Said Dunlang, 'Why sellest thou thine own daughter?'</p>

<p>"Said Dubhthach, 'She stayeth not from selling my wealth and
from giving it to the poor.'</p>

<p>"Said the King, 'Let the maiden come into the fortress.'</p>

<p>"Dubhthach went to Brigit, and was enraged against her because
she had given his sword to the poor man.</p>

<p>"When Brigit came into the King's presence the King said to
her, 'Since it is thy father's wealth that thou takest, much more
wilt thou take <i>my</i> wealth and my cattle and give them to the poor.'</p>

<p>"Said Brigit, 'The Son of the Virgin knoweth if I had thy might,
with all Leinster, and with all thy wealth, I would give them to the
Lord of the Elements.'</p>

<p>"Said the King to Dubhthach, 'Thou art not fit on either hand
to bargain about this maiden, for her merit is higher before God
than before men,' and the King gave Dubhthach an ivory-hilted sword
(<i>Claideb dét</i>), et sic liberata est sancta Virgo Brigita a captivititate.<a name="FNanchor_2_257" id="FNanchor_2_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_257" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>She at length succeeded in assuming the veil of a nun at
the hands of a bishop called Mucaille, along with seven virgin
companions. With these she eventually retired into her
father's territory and founded a church at Kildare, beside an
ancient oak-tree, which existed till the tenth century, and
which gives its name to the spot.<a name="FNanchor_3_258" id="FNanchor_3_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_258" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Even at this early
period Kildare seems to have been a racecourse, and St. Brigit
is described in the ancient lives as driving across it in her
chariot.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that there is scarcely any mention of St.
Brigit in the lives of St. Patrick, although, according to the
usual chronology they were partly contemporaries, St. Brigit
having become a nun about the year 467, and St. Patrick
having lived until 492. About the only mention of her in the
saint's life is that which tells how she once listened to Patrick
preaching for three nights and days, and fell asleep, and as she
dreamt she saw first white oxen in white corn-fields, and then
darker ones took their place, and lastly black oxen. And
thereafter, she beheld sheep and swine, and dogs and wolves
quarrelling with each other, and upon her waking up, St.
Patrick explained her dream as being symbolical of the history
of the Irish Church present and future. The life of Brigit
herself in the Book of Lismore tells the vision somewhat
differently:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I beheld,' said she, to Patrick, when he asked her why she had
fallen asleep, 'four ploughs in the north-east which ploughed the
whole island, and before the sowing was finished the harvest was
ripened, and clear well-springs and shiny streams came out of the
furrows. White garments were on the sowers and ploughmen. I
beheld four other ploughs in the north which ploughed the island
athwart and turned the harvest again, and the oats which they had
sown grew up at once and were ripe, and black streams came out of
the furrows, and there were black garments on the sowers and on the
ploughmen.'"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>This vision Patrick explained to her, saying&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'The first four ploughs which thou beheldest, those are I and
thou, who sow the four books of the gospel with a sowing of faith and
belief and piety. The harvest which thou beheldest are they who
come unto that faith and belief through our teaching. The four
ploughs which thou beheldest in the north are the false teachers and
the liars which will overturn the teaching which we have sown.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>St. Brigit's small oratory at Kildare, under the shadow of her
branching oak, soon grew into a great institution, and within
her own lifetime two considerable religious establishments
sprang up there, one for women and the other for men. She
herself selected a bishop to assist her in governing them, and
another to instruct herself and her nuns. Long before her
death, which occurred about the year 525, a regular city and a
great school rivalling the fame of Armagh itself, had risen
round her oak-tree. Cogitosus, himself one of the Kildare
monks, who wrote a Latin life of St. Brigit at the desire of the
community, gives us a fine description of the great church of
Kildare in his own day, which was evidently some time prior
to the Danish invasion at the close of the eighth century,<a name="FNanchor_4_259" id="FNanchor_4_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_259" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but
how long before is doubtful. He tells us that the church
was both large and lofty, with many pictures and hangings, and
with ornamental doorways, and that a partition ran across the
breadth of the church near the chancel or sanctuary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At one of its extremities there was a door which admitted the
bishop and his clergy to the sanctuary and to the altar; and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
other extremity on the opposite side there was a similar door by
which Brigit and her virgins and widows used to enter to enjoy the
banquet of the Body and Blood of Christ. Then a central partition
ran down the nave, dividing the men from the women, the men
being on the right and the women on the left, and each
division having its own lateral entrance. These partitions did
not rise to the roof of the church, but only so high as to serve
their purpose. The partition at the sanctuary or chancel was formed
with boards of wood decorated with pictures and covered with linen
hangings which might, it seems, be drawn aside at the consecration,
to give the people in the nave a better view of the holy mysteries."<a name="FNanchor_5_260" id="FNanchor_5_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_260" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The two institutions&mdash;nuns and monks&mdash;planted by St.
Brigit continued long to flourish side by side, and Kildare is
the only religious establishment in Ireland, says Dr. Healy,
which down to a comparatively recent period preserved the
double line of succession, of abbot-bishops and of abbesses. The
annalists always took care to record the names of the abbesses
with the same accuracy as those of the abbots, and to the last
the abbesses as successors of St. Brigit, were credited with, in
public opinion, and probably enjoyed in fact, a certain
supremacy over the bishops of Kildare themselves.</p>

<p>Amongst other occupations the monks and scholars of Kildare
seem to have given themselves up to decorative art, and a
school of metal work under the supervision of Brigit's first
bishop soon sprang into existence, producing all kinds of
artistically decorated chalices, bells, patens, and shrines; and
the impulse given thus early to artistic work and to beautiful
creations seems to have long propagated itself in Kildare, as
the description of the church by Cogitosus shows, and as we
may still conjecture from the exquisite round tower with its
unusually ornamented doorway and its great height of over 130
feet, the loftiest tower of the kind in Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt several attributes of the pagan Brigit,<a name="FNanchor_6_261" id="FNanchor_6_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_261" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who, as we
have seen, was accounted by the ancient Irish to have been the
goddess of poets, passed over to her Christian namesake, who
was also credited with being the patroness of men of learning.
On this, her life in the Book of Lismore contains the following
significant and rather obscure passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Brigit was once with her sheep on the Curragh, and she saw
running past her a son of reading,<a name="FNanchor_7_262" id="FNanchor_7_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_262" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to wit Nindid the scholar was he.</p>

<p>"'What makes thee unsedate, O son of reading?' saith Brigit, 'and
what seekest thou in that wise?'</p>

<p>"'O nun,' saith the scholar, 'I am going to heaven.'</p>

<p>"'The Virgin's son knoweth,' said Brigit, 'happy is he that goeth
that journey, and for God's sake make prayer with me that it may be
easy for me to go.'</p>

<p>"'O nun,' said the scholar, 'I have no leisure, for the gates of
heaven are open now and I fear they may be shut against me. Or,
if thou art hindering me pray the Lord that it may be easy for me to
go to heaven, and I will pray the Lord for thee, that it may be easy
for thee, and that thou mayest bring many thousands with thee, into
heaven.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Brigit recited a paternoster with him. And he was pious thenceforward,
and it is he that gave her communion and sacrifice when
she was dying. <i>Wherefore thence it came to pass that the comradeship
of the world's softs of reading is with Brigit, and the Lord gives them
through Brigit every perfect good they ask.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_8_263" id="FNanchor_8_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_263" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As St. Patrick is pre-eminently the patron saint of Ireland,
so is Brigit its patroness, and with the Irish people no Christian
name is more common for their boys than Patrick, or for their
girls than Brigit.<a name="FNanchor_9_264" id="FNanchor_9_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_264" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> She was universally known as the "Mary
of the Gael," and reverenced with a certain chivalric feeling
which seems to have been always present with the Gaelic nation
in the case of women, for, says her Irish life, her desire "was
to satisfy the poor, to expel every hardship, to spare every
miserable man.... It is she that helpeth every one who is in
a strait or a danger; it is she that abateth the pestilences; it is
she that quelleth the anger and the storm of the sea. She is
the prophetess of Christ: she is the queen of the south: <i>She
is the Mary of the Gael</i>." The writer closes thus in a burst
of eloquence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Her relics are on earth, with honour and dignity and primacy,
with miracles and marvels. Her soul is like a sun in the heavenly
kingdom, among the choir of angels and archangels. And though
great be her honour here at present, greater by far will it be when
she shall arise like a shining lamp, in completeness of body and soul
at the great Assembly of Doomsday, in union with cherubim and
seraphim, in union with the Son of Mary the Virgin, in the union
that is nobler than every union, in the union of the Holy Trinity,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."</p></blockquote>

<p>As of St. Patrick, so of his great co-evangeliser St. Brigit,
there exist quite a number of various lives; the most ancient
being probably a metrical life in Irish contained in the Book
of Hymns, of which there still exists an eleventh century MS.
It consists of fifty-three stanzas of four lines each, and is
ascribed to St. Broccan or Brogan Cloen, who seems to have
lived at the beginning of the seventh century.<a name="FNanchor_10_265" id="FNanchor_10_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_265" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This life does
little more than expatiate upon Brigit's miracles and virtues.
The next life of importance is that already mentioned, by
Cogitosus, the Kildare monk, whose date is uncertain, but is
clearly prior to the Danish invasions. This life, which is in
very creditable Latin, and four others, were printed by Colgan.
The first of these four is&mdash;probably falsely&mdash;attributed to St.
Ultan, who died in the middle of the seventh century; the
next is by a monk who is called Animosus, but of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
nothing is known, though, as St. Donatus, who became bishop
of Fiesole in 824, alludes to his works, he must have been an
early author; the third is a twelfth-century work, by Laurence
of Durham, an Englishman; and the last is in Latin verse,
taken from a MS. which the unwearied Colgan procured from
Monte Cassino, and which is attributed to Coelan, a monk of
Iniscaltra, who probably lived in the eighth century, while a
prologue to this life is prefixed by a later writer, the celebrated
Irish bishop of Fiesole, Donatus, who, in the early part of the
ninth century, worked with great success in Italy. There is
something touching in the language with which this great and
successful child of the Gael reverts in his prologue to the home
of his childhood:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Far in the west they tell of a matchless land,<a name="FNanchor_11_266" id="FNanchor_11_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_266" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which goes in
ancient books by the name of Scotia [<i>i.e.</i>, Ireland]; rich in resources
this land, having silver, precious stones, vestures and gold, well suited
to earth-born creatures as regards its climate, its sun, and its arable
soil; that Scotia of lovely fields that flow with milk and honey, hath
skill in husbandry, and raiments, and arms, and arts, and fruits. There
are no fierce bears there, nor ever has the land of Scotia brought
forth savage broods of lions. No poisons hurt, no serpent creeps
through the grass, nor does the babbling frog croak and complain by
the lake. In this land the Scottish race are worthy to dwell, a
renowned race of men in war, in peace, in fidelity."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitley Stokes has published the Irish lives of St. Brigit
from the Leabhar Breac and the Book of Lismore, and
Donatus alludes to other lives by St. Ultan<a name="FNanchor_12_267" id="FNanchor_12_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_267" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and St. Eleran,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
so that Brigit has not lacked biographers. She herself is said
to have written a rule for her nuns and some other things, and
O'Curry prints one Irish poem ascribed to her&mdash;in which she
prays for the family of heaven to be present at her feast:
"I should like the men of heaven in my own house, I
should like rivers of peace to be at their disposal," etc.&mdash;which
appears to be alluded to in the preface to the Litany
of Angus the Culdee, as the "great feast which St. Brigit
made for Jesus in her heart."<a name="FNanchor_13_268" id="FNanchor_13_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_268" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

piping times of peace which Ireland enjoyed in the seventh and eighth
centuries. It would have been impossible to have written in this way after
the close of the eighth century. See chap. 36 of Cogitosus's life, "Trias
Thaumaturga," p. 524 of the Louvain edition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_260" id="Footnote_5_260"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_260"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Thus well summarised by Dr. Healy from the more diffuse Latin of
Cogitosus. His description of the church is as follows: It was "solo
spatiosa et in altum minaci proceritate porrecta ac decorata pictis tabulis,
tria intrinsecus habens oratoria ampla, et divisa parietibus tabulatis." One of
the walls was "decoratus, et imaginibus depictus, ac linteaminibus tectus."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_261" id="Footnote_6_261"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_261"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This has not escaped Windisch. "Während," he writes, "Patrick nur der
christlichen Hagiologie angehört, scheint Brigit zugleich die Erbin einer
alten heidnischen Gottheit zu sein. Ihr Wesen enthält Ziige die mehr
als eine heilig gesprochen Nonne hinter ihr vermuthen lassen." Windisch
bases this chiefly upon the expressions in Broccan's hymn, which calls her
the mother of Christ, and calls Christ her son, and equates her with Mary.
The passage which I have adduced from the Irish life is even more
remarkable:
</p>
<p>
"Brigit," writes Whitley Stokes "(cp. Skr. <i>bhargas</i>) was born at sunrise
neither within nor without a house, was bathed in milk, her breath revives
the dead, a house in which she is staying flames up to heaven, cow-dung
blazes before her, oil is poured on her head; she is fed from the milk of
a white red-eared cow; a fiery pillar rises over her head; sun rays support
her wet cloak; she remains a virgin; and she was one of the two mothers
of Christ the Anointed. She has, according to Giraldus Cambrensis, a
perpetual ashless fire watched by twenty nuns, of whom herself was one,
blown by fans or bellows only, and surrounded by a hedge within which
no male could enter" ("Top. Hib." chaps. 34, 35 and 36), from all which Stokes
declares that one may without much rashness pick out certain of her life-incidents,
as having "originally belonged to the myth or the ritual of some
goddess of fire." (<i>See</i> preface to "Three Middle Irish Homilies.")</p></div>

to the action of various influences, particularly of the National Board,
with unsympathetic persons at its head, and of the men who direct
the modern education of the Irish, the people who are not allowed by the
National Board to learn history, and who are taught to despise the Irish
language, are gradually being made ashamed of any names that are not
English, and Patrick and Brigit almost bid fair to follow the way of
Cormac, Conn, Felim, Art, Donough, Fergus, Diarmuid, and a score of
other Christian names of men in common use a century ago, but now
almost wholly extinct, and of Mève, Sive, Eefi, Sheela, Nuala, and as many
more female names now nearly or completely obsolete. A woman of
some education said to me lately, "God forbid I should handicap my
daughter in life by calling her Brigit;" and a Catholic bishop said the
other day that too often when an Irish parent abroad did pluck up courage
to christen his son "Patrick," he put it in, in a shamefaced whisper, at
the end of several other names. This is the direct result of the teaching
given by the National Board.</p></div>

died in 653, but, as Windisch remarks, mention is probably made of Ultan
only because he is said to have been the first to collect the miracles of
Brigit&mdash;"die Sprache," adds Windisch, "ist alterthümlich; besonders
beachtenswerth sind die ziemlich zahlreichen Perfectformen." It is remarkable
that the miracles attributed to Brigit are given in the same order in
this hymn and in Cogitosus' life of her. The metre is irregular.

The life by Cogitosus is evidently pre-Danish, and it is more likely to be
an extension of the short metrical one, than that the metrical one should
be a <i>résumé</i> of it. If this is so it bespeaks a considerable antiquity for the
Irish verses.</p></div>

<h4>COLUMCILLE</h4>


<p>The third great patron Saint of Ireland, the man who stands
out almost as conspicuously as St. Patrick himself in the
religious history of the Gael, the most renowned missionary,
scribe, scholar, poet, statesman, anchorite, and school-founder
of the sixth century is St. Columcille.<a name="FNanchor_1_269" id="FNanchor_1_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_269" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Everything about this
remarkable man has conspired to fix upon him the imagination
of the Irish race. He was not, like St. Patrick, of alien, nor
like St. Brigit, of semi-servile birth, but was sprung from the
highest and bluest blood of the Irish, being son of Felemidh,
son of Fergus, son of Conall Gulban&mdash;renowned to this day in
saga and romance&mdash;son of Niall of the Nine Hostages, that
great monarch of Ireland who ravaged Britain and exacted
tributes far and wide from his conquered enemies.</p>

<p>He was born on the 7th of December, 521,<a name="FNanchor_2_270" id="FNanchor_2_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_270" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> twenty-nine
years after the reputed death of St. Patrick, and four years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
before that of St. Brigit, at Gartan<a name="FNanchor_3_271" id="FNanchor_3_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_271" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in Donegal, a wild but
beautiful district of which his father was the prince. The
reigning monarch of Ireland was his half-uncle, while his mother
Ethne was the direct descendant of the royal line of Cáthaoir
[Cauheer] Mór, the regnant family of Leinster, and he himself
would have had some chance of the reversion of the monarchy
had he been minded to press his claims. Reared at Kilmacrenan,
near Gartan, the place where the O'Donnells were afterwards
inaugurated, he received his first teaching at the hands of
St. Finnén or Finnian in his famous school at Moville, for
already since Patrick's death Ireland had become dotted with
such small colleges. It was here at this early age that his
school-fellows christened him Colum-cille, or Colum of the
Church, on account of the assiduity with which he sought
the holy building. At this period the Christian clergy and the
bardic order were the only two educational powers in Ireland,
and after leaving St. Finnian, Columcille travelled south into
Leinster to a bard called Gemmán<a name="FNanchor_4_272" id="FNanchor_4_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_272" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> with whom he took lessons.
From him he went to St. Finnén or Finnian of Clonard.
While studying at Clonard it was the custom for each of the
students to grind corn in his turn at a quern, but Columcille's
Irish life in the Book of Lismore tells us naïvely, in true old
Irish spirit, "howbeit an angel from heaven used to grind on
behalf of Columcille; that was the honour which the Lord
used to render him because of the eminent nobleness of his
race." St. Ciaran [Keeran] was at this time a fellow-student
with him, and Finnian, says the Irish life, saw one night a
vision, "to wit, two moons arose from Clonard, a golden moon
and a silver moon. The golden moon went into the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of the island, and Ireland and Scotland gleamed under it. The
silver moon went on until it stayed by the Shannon, and
Ireland at her centre gleamed." That, says the author,
signified "Columcille with the grace of his noble kin and
his wisdom, and Ciaran with the refulgence of his virtues
and his good deeds."</p>

<p>Leaving Clonard behind him, Columcille passed on to yet
another school&mdash;this time to that of Mobhí at Glasnevin, near
Dublin, where there were as many as fifty students at work,
living in huts or cells grouped round an oratory, some of whom
were famous men in after-time, for they included Cainnech and
Comgall and Ciaran. A curious incident is recorded of these
three and of Columcille in the Irish life in the Book of Lismore.</p>

<p>Columcille was driven from Glasnevin by the approach of
the great plague which ravaged the country, and of which
his teacher Mobhí died.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Once on a time," says the author, "a great church was built by
Mobhí. The clerics were considering what each of them would
like to have in the church. 'I should like,' said Ciaran, 'its full of
church children to attend the canonical hours.' 'I should like,' said
Cainnech, 'to have its full of books to serve the sons of life.' 'I
should like,' said Comgall, 'its full of affliction and disease to be in
my own body: to subdue me and repress me.' Then Columcille
chose its full of gold and silver to cover relics and shrines withal.
Mobhí said it should not be so, but that Columcille's community
would be wealthier than any community, whether in Ireland or in
Scotland."<a name="FNanchor_5_273" id="FNanchor_5_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_273" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Betaking himself northward with a growing reputation, he
was offered by his cousin, then Prince of Aileach, near Derry,
and afterwards monarch of Ireland, the site of a monastery on
the so-called island of Derry, a rising ground of oval shape,
covering some two hundred acres, along the slopes of which
flourished a splendid forest of oak-trees, which gave to the
oasis its name of Derry or the oak grove. Columcille, like
all Gaels&mdash;and indeed all Celts&mdash;was full of love for everything
beautiful in nature, both animate and inanimate, and so
careful was he of his beloved oaks that, contrary to all custom,
he would not build his church with its chancel towards the
east, for in that case some of the oaks would have had to be
felled to make room for it. He laid strict injunctions upon all
his successors to spare the lovely grove, and enjoined that if
any of the trees should be blown down some of them should go
for fuel to their own guest-house, and the rest be given to
the people.</p>

<p>This was Columcille's first religious institution, and, like
every man's firstling, it remained dear to him to the last.
Years afterwards, when the thought of it came back to him
on the barren shores of Iona, he expressed himself in passionate
Irish poetry.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For oh! were the tributes of Alba mine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From shore unto centre, from centre to sea,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the midst of fair Derry were dearer to me.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That spot is the dearest on Erin's ground,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the treasures that peace and that purity lend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the hosts of bright angels that circle it round,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Protecting its borders from end to end.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dearest of any on Erin's ground</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For its peace and its beauty I gave it my love,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each leaf of the oaks around Derry is found</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To be crowded with angels from heaven above.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">My Derry! my Derry! my little oak grove,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My dwelling, my home, and my own little cell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May God the Eternal in Heaven above</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Send death to thy foes and defend thee well."<a name="FNanchor_6_274" id="FNanchor_6_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_274" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Columcille was yet a young man, only twenty-five years of
age, when he founded Derry, but both his own genius, and
more especially his great friends and kinsfolk, had conspired to
make him famous. For the next seventeen years he laboured
in Ireland, and during this time founded the still more
celebrated schools of Durrow in the present King's County,
and of Kells in Meath, both of which became most famous in
after years. Durrow,<a name="FNanchor_7_275" id="FNanchor_7_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_275" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> which, like Derry, was named from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the beautiful groves of oak which were scattered along the slope
of Druim-caín, or "the pleasant hill," seems to have retained
to the last a hold upon the affections of Columcille second only
to that of Derry. When its abbot, Cormac the voyager,
visited him long years afterwards in Iona, and expressed his
unwillingness to return to his monastery again, because, being
a Momonian of the race of Eber, the southern Ui Neill were
jealous of him, and made his abbacy unpleasant or impossible,
Columcille reproached him in pathetic terms for abandoning so
lovely an abode&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With its books and its learning,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A devout city with a hundred crosses."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"O Cormac," he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I pledge thee mine unerring word</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which it is not possible to impugn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Death is better in reproachless Erin</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than perpetual life in Alba [Scotland]."<a name="FNanchor_8_276" id="FNanchor_8_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_276" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>And on another occasion, when it strikes him how happy
the son of Dima, <i>i.e.</i>, Cormac, must be at the approach of
summer along the green hillside of Rosgrencha&mdash;another
name for Durrow&mdash;amid its fair slopes, waving woods, and
singing birds, compared with himself exiled to the barren
shores of rugged Iona, he bursts forth into the tenderest
song&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"How happy the son is of Dima! no sorrow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">For him is designed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is having, this hour, round his own cell in Durrow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">The wish of his mind:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sound of the wind in the elms, like the strings of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">A harp being played,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The note of the blackbird that claps with the wings of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Delight in the glade.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With him in Rosgrencha the cattle are lowing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">At earliest dawn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the brink of the summer the pigeons are cooing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">And doves on his lawn," etc.<a name="FNanchor_9_277" id="FNanchor_9_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_277" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Columcille continued his labours in Ireland, founding
churches and monasteries and schools, until he was forty-two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
years of age. He was at this time at the height of his physical
and mental powers, a man of a masterful but of a too passionate
character, of fine physique, and enjoying a reputation
second to that of none in Erin. The commentator in the
Féilire of Angus describes his appearance as that of "a man
well-formed, with powerful frame; his skin was white, his
face was broad and fair and radiant, lit up with large, grey,<a name="FNanchor_10_278" id="FNanchor_10_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_278" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
luminous eyes; his large and well-shaped head was crowned,
except where he wore his frontal tonsure, with close and
curling hair. His voice was clear and resonant, so that he
could be heard at the distance of 1,500 paces,<a name="FNanchor_11_279" id="FNanchor_11_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_279" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> yet sweet with
more than the sweetness of the bards." His activity was
incessant. "Not a single hour of the day," says Adamnan,
"did he leave unoccupied without engaging either in prayer,
or in reading, or in writing, or in some other work;" and he
laboured with his hands as well as with his head, cooking or
looking after his ploughmen, or engaged in ecclesiastical or
secular matters. All accounts go to show that he was of a
hot and passionate temperament, and endowed with both the
virtues and the faults that spring from such a character.
Indeed this was, no doubt, why in the "famous vision"<a name="FNanchor_12_280" id="FNanchor_12_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_280" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
which Baithin saw concerning him, he was seated only on
a chair of glass; while Ciaran was on a chair of gold, and
Molaisse upon a chair of silver. The commentator on the
Féilire of Angus boldly states that, "though his devotion was
delightful, he was carnal and often frail even as glass is fragile."
Aware of this, he wore himself out with fastings and vigils,<a name="FNanchor_13_281" id="FNanchor_13_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_281" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
and no doubt&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Lenior et melior fit accedente senectu,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>for Adamnan describes him, from the recollections of the
monks who knew him, as being angelic in aspect<a name="FNanchor_14_282" id="FNanchor_14_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_282" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and bright
in conversation, and despite his great labours yet "dear to all,
displaying his holy countenance always cheerful." A curious
story is told in the Leabhar Breac, of the stratagems to which
his people resorted to checkmate his self-imposed penance; for
having one day seen an old woman living upon pottage of
nettles, while she was waiting for her one cow to calve and
give her milk, the notion came to him that he too would
thenceforward live upon the same, for if she could do so, much
more could he, and it would be profitable to his soul in gaining
the kingdom of heaven. So, said the writer, he called his servant&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Pottage,' saith he, 'from thee every night, and bring not the
milk with it.'</p>

<p>"'It shall be done,' said the cook.</p>

<p>"He (the cook) bores the mixing-stick of the pottage, so that it
became a pipe, and he used to pour the meat juice into the pipe,
down, so that it was mixed through the pottage. That preserves
the cleric's (Columcille's) appearance. The monks perceived the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
cleric's good appearance, and they talked among themselves. That
is revealed to Columcille, so he said, 'May your successors be
always murmuring.'</p>

<p>"'Well now,' said Columcille, said he, to his servant, 'what dost
thou give me every day?'</p>

<p>"'Thou art witness,' said the cook, 'unless it come out of the iron
of the pot, or out of the stick wherewith the pottage is mixed, I know
nought else in it save pottage!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>It was now, however, that events occurred which had the
result of driving Columcille abroad and launching him upon
a more stormy and more dangerous career, as the apostle of
Scotland and the Picts. St. Finnian of Moville, with whom he
studied in former days, had brought back with him from Rome
a copy of the Psalms, probably the first copy of St. Jerome's
translation, or Vulgate, that had appeared in Ireland, which he
highly valued, and which he did not wish Columcille to copy.
Columcille however, who was a dexterous and rapid scribe,
found opportunity, by sitting up during several nights, to make
a copy of the book secretly,<a name="FNanchor_15_283" id="FNanchor_15_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_283" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but Finnian learning it claimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the copy. Columcille refused it, and the matter was referred
to King Diarmuid at Tara. The monarch, to whom books
and their surroundings were probably something new, as a
matter for legal dispute, could find in the Brehon law no
nearer analogy to adjudicate the case by, than the since celebrated
sentence <i>le gach boin a boinín</i>, "with every cow her calf,"
in which terms he, not altogether unnaturally, decided in
favour of St. Finnian, saying, "with every book its son-book,
as with every cow her calf."<a name="FNanchor_16_284" id="FNanchor_16_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_284" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This alone might not have
brought about the crisis, but unfortunately the son of the king
of Connacht, who had been present at the great Convention or
Féis of Tara, in utter violation of the law of sanctuary which
alone rendered this great meeting possible, slew the son of the
king's steward, and knowing that the penalty was certain
death, he fled to the lodging of the northern princes Fergus
and Domhnall [Donall] who immediately placed him under the
protection of St. Columcille. This however did not avail him,
for King Diarmuid, who was no respecter of persons, had him
promptly seized and put to death in atonement for his crime.
This, combined with his unfortunate judgment about the
book, enraged the imperious Columcille to the last degree.
He made his way northward and appealed to his kinsmen to
avenge him. A great army was collected, led by Fergus and
Domhnall, two first cousins of Columcille, and by the king
of Connacht, whose son had been put to death. The High-king
marched to meet this formidable combination with all
the troops he could gather. Pushing his way across the island
he met their combined forces in the present county of Sligo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
between Benbulbin and the sea. A furious battle was delivered
in which he was defeated with the loss of three thousand
men.</p>

<p>It was soon after this battle that Columcille decided to leave
Ireland. There is a great deal of evidence that he did so as a
kind of penance, either self-imposed or enjoined upon him by
St. Molaíse [Moleesha], as Keating says, or by the "synod of
the Irish saints," as O'Donnell has it. He had helped to fill
all Ireland with arms and bloodshed, and three thousand men
had fallen in one battle largely on account of him, and it was
not the only appeal to arms which lay upon his conscience.<a name="FNanchor_17_285" id="FNanchor_17_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_285" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
He set sail from his beloved Derry in the year 593, determined,
according to popular tradition, to convert as many souls to
Christ as had fallen in the battle of Cooldrevna. Amongst
the dozen monks of his own order who accompanied him were
his two first cousins and his uncle.</p>

<p>It was death and breaking of heart for him to leave the land
of Erin, and he pathetically expresses his sorrow in his own
Irish verses.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Too swiftly my coracle flies on her way,</span><br />

<p>Columcille is the first example in the saddened page of Irish
history of the exiled Gael grieving for his native land and
refusing to be comforted, and as such he has become the very
type and embodiment of Irish fate and Irish character. The
flag in bleak Gartan, upon which he was born, is worn thin
and bare by the hands and feet of pious pilgrims, and "the
poor emigrants who are about to quit Donegal for ever, come
and sleep on that flag the night before their departure from
Derry. Columcille himself was an exile, and they fondly hope
that sleeping on the spot where he was born will help them to
bear with lighter heart the heavy burden of the exile's
sorrows."<a name="FNanchor_19_287" id="FNanchor_19_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_287" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He is the prototype of the millions of Irish exiles
in after ages&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>and the extraordinary deep roots which his life and poetry have
struck into the soil of the North was strikingly evidenced this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
very year (1898) by the wonderful celebration of his centenary at
Gartan, at which many thousands of people, who had travelled
all night over the surrounding mountains, were present, and
where it was felt to be so incongruous that the life of such a
great Irish patriot, prince, and poet, in the diocese, too, of an
O'Donnell, should be celebrated in English, that&mdash;probably for
the first time in this century&mdash;Irish poems were read and Irish
speeches made, even by the Cardinal-Primate and the
Bishop of the diocese.</p>

<p>Of Columcille's life on the craggy little island of Iona, of
his splendid labours in converting the Picts, and of the
monastery which he established, and which, occupied by Irish
monks, virtually rendered Iona an Irish island for the next
six hundred years, there is no need to speak here, for these
things belong rather to ecclesiastical than to literary history.</p>

<p>Columcille himself was an unwearied scribe, and delighted
in poetry. Ample provision was made for the multiplication
of books in all the monasteries which he founded, and his
Irish life tells us that he himself wrote "three hundred
gifted, lasting, illuminated, noble books." The life in the
Book of Lismore tells us that he once went to Clonmacnois
with a hymn he had made for St. Ciaran, 'for he made
abundant praises for God's household, as said the poet,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Noble, thrice fifty, nobler than every apostle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The number of miracles [of poems] are as grass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some in Latin, which was beguiling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Others in Gaelic, fair the tale."'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Of these only three in Latin are now known to exist, whilst
of the great number of Irish poems attributed to him only a
few&mdash;half a dozen at the most&mdash;are likely to be even partly
genuine. His best known hymn is the "Altus," so called
from its opening word; it was first printed by Colgan,<a name="FNanchor_21_289" id="FNanchor_21_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_289" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
its genuineness is generally admitted. It is a long and rudely-constructed
poem, of twenty-two stanzas, preserved in the
Book of Hymns, a MS. probably of the eleventh century.
Each stanza consists of six lines,<a name="FNanchor_22_290" id="FNanchor_22_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_290" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and each line of sixteen
syllables. There is a pause after the eighth syllable, and a
kind of rhyme between every two lines. The first verses run
thus with an utter disregard of quantity.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Altus pros&#259;tor, vetustus dierum et ingenitus,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Erat absque origine primordii et crepidine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Est et erit in sæcula sæculorum infinitus,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cui est unigenitus Christus et Spiritus Sanctus," etc.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The second Latin hymn is a supplement to this one, composed
in praise of the Trinity, because Pope Gregory who, as
the legend states, perceived the angels listening when the "Altus"
was recited to him, was yet of opinion that the first stanza of
the original poem, despite its additional line, was insufficient to
express a competent laudation of the mystery, consequently
Columcille added, it was said, fifteen rude-rhyming couplets of
the same character as the "Altus," but it is very doubtful whether
they are genuine. The third hymn, the "Noli Pater," is still
shorter, consisting of only seven rhyming couplets with sixteen
syllables in each line. It was in ancient times considered an
efficient safeguard against fire and lightning. Some of his reputed
Irish poems we have already glanced at; three that Colgan considered
genuine were printed by Dr. Reeves in his "Adamnan;"
and another, the touching "Farewell to Ara," is contained in the
"Gaelic Miscellany" of 1808; and another on his escape from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
King Diarmuid, when the king of Connacht's son was put
to death for violating the Féis at Tara, is printed in the
"Miscellany" of the Irish Archæological Society.<a name="FNanchor_23_291" id="FNanchor_23_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_291" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> There are
three verses, composed by him as a prayer at the battle of
Cooldrevna, ascribed to him in the "Chronicon Scotorum;" and
there is a collection of fifteen poems attributed to him in the
O'Clery MSS. at Brussels, and nearly a hundred more&mdash;mostly
evident forgeries&mdash;in the Bodleian at Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_24_292" id="FNanchor_24_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_292" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He does not
seem to have ever written any work in prose.</p>

<p>There are six lives of Columcille still extant, the greatest of
them all being that in Latin by Adamnan,<a name="FNanchor_25_293" id="FNanchor_25_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_293" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> who was one of
his successors in the abbacy of Iona, and who was born only
twenty-seven years after Columcille's death. This admirable
work, written in flowing and very fair Latin, was derived, as
Adamnan himself tells us, partly from oral and partly from
written sources. A memoir of Columcille had already been
written by Cuimine Finn or Cummeneus Albus,<a name="FNanchor_26_294" id="FNanchor_26_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_294" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> as Adamnan
calls him, the last Abbot of Iona but one before himself, and
that memoir he almost entirely embodied in his third book.
He had also some other written accounts before him, and the
Irish poems, both of the saint himself and of other bards,
amongst them Baithine Mór, who had enjoyed his personal
friendship, and St. Mura, who was a little his junior&mdash;poems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
now lost. He had also constant opportunities of conversing
with those who had seen the great saint and had been familiar
with him in life, and he was writing on the spot and amidst
the associations and surroundings wherein his last thirty years
had been spent, and which were inseparably connected with
his memory. The result was that he produced a work, which
although not ostensibly a history, and dealing only with the
life of a single man, and that rather from the transcendental
than from the practical side, is nevertheless of the utmost value
to the historian on account not only of the general picture of
manners and customs, but still more on account of its incidental
references to contemporary history. "It is," says Pinkerton,
who, as Dr. Reeves remarks, was a writer not over-given to
eulogy, "the most complete piece of such biography that all
Europe can boast of, not only at so early a period but even
through the whole Middle Ages." Adamnan's other great
work on Sacred Places is mentioned by his contemporary, the
Venerable Bede, but he is silent as to Columcille's life. There
is, however, abundant internal evidence of its authenticity.
This evidence, however it might satisfy the minds of mere
Irish students like Colgan and Stephen White, proved insufficient,
however, to meet the exacting claims of certain
British scholars. "I cannot agree," said Sir James Dalrymple,
in the last century, "that the authority of Adamnanus is equal,
far less preferable to that of Bede, since it was agreed on all
hands to be a fabulous history lately published in his name, and
that he was remarkable for nothing, but that he was the first
abbot of that monastery who quit the <i>Scottish</i> institution, and
became fond of the <i>English Romish</i> Rites."<a name="FNanchor_27_295" id="FNanchor_27_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_295" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Dr. Giles, too,
who thought of editing it, tells us in his translation of
Bede's "Ecclesiastical History," that he had "strong doubts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Adamnan's having written it."<a name="FNanchor_28_296" id="FNanchor_28_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_296" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> And, finally, Schoell, a German,
professed to have convinced himself that Adamnan's preface
could not have been written by the same hand which wrote
the life, so different did the style of the two appear to him,
and wholly rejected it as a work of the seventh century written
at Iona.</p>

<p>But it so happened that shortly before the year 1851, when
Schoell was impugning the genuineness of this work, the
ancient manuscript from which it had been copied by the
Irish Jesuit, Stephen White&mdash;and, from his copy, printed by
Colgan&mdash;actually came to light again, discovered by Dr.
Ferdinand Keller at the bottom of an old book-shelf in the
public library of Schaffhausen, into which it had been turned
with some other old manuscripts and books. A close examination
of this remarkable text written in a heavy round Irish
hand, in nearly the same type of script as the Books of Kells
and Durrow, and of a more archaic character than that of the
Book of Armagh (written in 807), rendered it certain that
here was a codex of great value and antiquity. Nor was the
usual colophon containing the scribe's name and asking a prayer
for him missing. That name was Dorbene, a most rare one, of
which only two instances are known, both connected with
Iona, the first of which records the death of Faelcu, son of
Dorbene, in 729, but as we know that Faelcu died in his
eighty-second year his father could hardly have been the scribe.
The other Dorbene was elected abbot of Iona in 713 and died
the same year, so that it may be regarded as almost certain that
this book was written by him and that this copy is in his
handwriting. We have in this codex, then, the actual handwriting<a name="FNanchor_29_297" id="FNanchor_29_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_297" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
of a contemporary of Adamnan himself, the handiwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of the generation which succeeded Columcille, a volume
a hundred years older than even the Book of Armagh, a
volume which had been carried over to some of the numerous
Irish institutions on the Continent after the break-up of Iona
by the Northmen. There are several corrections of the
orthography in a different and later hand, the date of which
is fixed by Dr. Keller at 800-820, and these are evidently the
work of a German monk, who was displeased with the peculiar
orthography of the Irish school, and who made these emendations
after the MS. had been brought from Iona to the
Continent. The following passage describing the last hours
of Columcille will both serve as a specimen of Adamnan's style
and also afford a minutely particular account of the end of this
great man. Its accuracy can hardly be impugned as it is
written by one who had every minute particular from eye-witnesses,
and as the actual manuscript from which it is
printed was copied from the author's own, either during his
life or within less than ten years after his death.<a name="FNanchor_30_298" id="FNanchor_30_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_298" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Adamnan first tells us of several premonitions which the
saint had of his approaching end, how he, "now an old man,
wearied with age," was borne in his waggon to view his monks
labouring in the fields on the western slope of the island, and
intimated to them that his end was not far off, but that lest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
their Easter should be one of grief, he would not be taken
from them until it was over. Later on in the year he went
out with his servant Diarmuid to inspect the granary, and was
pleased at the two large heaps of grain which were lying there,
and remarked that though he should be taken from his dear
monks, yet he was glad to see that they had a supply for the
year.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And," says Adamnan, "when Diarmuid his servant heard this he
began to be sad, and said, 'Father, at this time of year you sadden
us too often, because you speak frequently about your decease.'
When the saint thus answered, 'I have a secret word to tell you,
which, if you promise me faithfully not to make it known to any
before my death, I shall be able to let you know more clearly about
my departure.' And when his servant, on bended knees, had
finished making this promise, the venerable man thus continued,
'This day is called in the sacred volumes the Sabbath, which is
interpreted Rest. And this day is indeed to me a sabbath, because
it is my last of this present laborious life, in which, after the trouble
of my toil, I take my rest; for in the middle of this coming sacred
Sunday night, I shall to use the Scripture phrase, tread the way of
my fathers; for now my Lord Jesus Christ deigns to invite me, to
whom, I say, at the middle of this night, on His own invitation, I
shall pass over; for it was thus revealed to me by the Lord Himself.'
His servant, hearing these sad words, begins to weep bitterly: whom
the saint endeavoured to console as much as he was able.</p>

<p>"After this the saint goes forth from the barn, and returning to
the monastery sits down on the way, at the place where afterwards
a cross let into a millstone, and to-day standing there, may be perceived
on the brink of the road. And while the saint, wearied with
old age, as I said before, sitting in that place was taking a rest, lo!
the white horse, the obedient servant who used to carry the milk-vessels
between the monastery and the byre, meets him. It,
wonderful to relate, approached the saint and placing its head in
his bosom, by the inspiration of God, as I believe, for whom every
animal is wise with the measure of sense which his Creator has
bidden, knowing that his master was about to immediately depart
from him, and that he would see him no more, begins to lament and
abundantly to pour forth tears, like a human being, into the saint's
lap, and with beslavered mouth to make moan. Which when the
servant saw, he proceeds to drive away the tearful mourner, but the
saint stopped him, saying, 'Allow him, allow him who loves me, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
pour his flood of bitterest tears into this my bosom. See, you,
though you are a man and have a rational mind, could have in no
way known about my departure if I had not myself lately disclosed
it to you, but to this brute and irrational animal the Creator Himself,
in His own way, has clearly revealed that his master is about to
depart from him.' And saying this he blessed the sorrowful horse
[the monastery's] servant, as it turned away from him.</p>

<p>"And going forth from thence and ascending a small hill, which
rose over the monastery, he stood for a little upon its summit, and
as he stood, elevating both his palms, he blessed his community and
said, 'Upon this place however narrow and mean, not only shall the
kings of the Scots [<i>i.e.</i>, Irish] with their peoples, but also the rulers
of foreign and barbarous nations with the people subject to them,
confer great and no ordinary honour. By the saints of other
churches also, shall no common respect be accorded it.'</p>

<p>"After these words, going down from the little hill and returning
to the monastery, he sat in his cell writing a copy of the Psalms, and
on reaching that verse of the thirty-third Psalm where it is written,
'But they that seek the Lord shall lack no thing that is good;'
'Here,' said he, 'we may close at the end of the page; let Baithin
write what follows.' Well appropriate for the parting saint was
the last verse which he had written, for to him shall good things
eternal be never lacking, while to the father who succeeded him
[Baithin], the teacher of his spiritual sons, the following [words]
were particularly apposite, 'Come, my sons, hearken unto me. I
shall teach you the fear of the Lord,' since as the departing one
desired, he was his successor not only in teaching but also in
writing.<a name="FNanchor_31_299" id="FNanchor_31_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_299" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>"After writing the above verse and finishing the page, the saint
enters the church for the vesper office preceding the Sunday; which
finished, he returned to his little room, and rested for the night on
his couch, where for mattress he had a bare flag, and for pillow
a stone, which at this day stands as a kind of commemorative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
monument beside his tomb.<a name="FNanchor_32_300" id="FNanchor_32_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_300" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> And there, sitting, he gives his last
mandates to the brethren, in the hearing of his servant only, saying,
'These last words of mine I commend to you, O little children, that
ye preserve a mutual charity with peace, and a charity not feigned
amongst yourselves; and if ye observe to do this according to the
example of the holy fathers, God, the comforter of the good, shall
help you, and I, remaining with Him, shall make intercession for
you, and not only the necessaries of this present life shall be
sufficiently supplied you by Him, but also the reward of eternal
good, prepared for the observers of things Divine, shall be rendered
you.' Up to this point the last words of our venerable patron [when
now] passing as it were from this wearisome pilgrimage to his
heavenly country, have been briefly narrated.</p>

<p>"After which, his joyful last hour gradually approaching, the
saint was silent. Then soon after, when the struck bell resounded
in the middle of the night,<a name="FNanchor_33_301" id="FNanchor_33_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_301" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> quickly rising he goes to the church, and
hastening more quickly than the others he entered alone, and with
bent knees inclines beside the altar in prayer. His servant,
Diarmuid, following more slowly, at the same moment beholds, from
a distance, the whole church inside filled with angelic light round
the saint; but as he approached the door this same light, which he had
seen, swiftly vanished; which light a few others of the brethren, also
standing at a distance, had seen. Diarmuid then entering the church,
calls aloud with a voice choked with tears, 'Where art thou, Father?'
And the lamps of the brethren not yet being brought, groping in
the dark, he found the saint recumbent before the altar: raising
him up a little, and sitting beside him, he placed the sacred head in
his own bosom. And while this was happening a crowd of monks
running up with lights, and seeing their father dying, begin to
lament. And as we have learned from some who were there
present, the saint, his soul not yet departing, with eyes upraised,
looked round on each side, with a countenance of wondrous joy and
gladness, as though beholding the holy angels coming to meet him.
Diarmuid then raises up the saint's right hand to bless the band of
monks. But the venerable father himself, too, in so far as he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
able, was moving his hand at the same time, so that he might appear
to bless the brethren with the motion of his hand, what he could not
do with his voice, during his soul's departure. And after thus
signifying his sacred benediction, he straightway breathed forth
his life. When it had gone forth from the tabernacle of his body,
the countenance remained so long glowing and gladdened in a
wonderful manner by the angelic vision, that it appeared not that
of a dead man but of a living one sleeping. In the meantime the
whole church resounded with sorrowful lamentations."<a name="FNanchor_34_302" id="FNanchor_34_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_302" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides the lives of Columcille, written by Adamnan and
Cummene, at least four more exist; an anonymous life in
Latin, printed by Colgan and erroneously supposed by him
to be that of Cummene; a life by John of Tinmouth, chiefly
compiled from Adamnan, which is also printed by Colgan;
the old Irish life contained in four Irish MSS., namely, in the
Leabhar Breac, in the Book of Lismore, in a vellum MS. in
Edinburgh, and in an Irish parchment volume found by the
Revolutionary Commissioners, during the Republic, in a
private house in Paris, and by them presented to the Royal
Library of that city&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Quæ regio in terris nostri non plena laboris!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>This life has been printed from the Book of Lismore by
Dr. Whitley Stokes. The last and most copious life is a
compilation of all existing documents and poems both in
Latin and Old Irish, and was made by order of O'Donnell
in 1532.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Be it known," says the preface, "to the readers of this Life that
it was Manus, son of Hugh, son of Hugh Roe, son of Niall Garv, son
of Turlough of the wise O'Donnell, who ordered the part of this
Life which was in Latin to be put into Gaelic; and who ordered
the part that was in difficult Gaelic to be modified, so that it might
be clear and comprehensible to every one; and who gathered and
put together the parts of it that were scattered through the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Books of Erin; and who dictated it out of his own mouth with great
labour and a great expenditure of time in studying how he should
arrange all its parts in their proper places, as they are left here in
writing by us; and in love and friendship for his illustrious saint,
relative, and patron, to whom he was devoutly attached. It was in
the Castle of Port-na-tri-námhad [Lifford] that his Life was indited,
when were fulfilled 12 years and 20 and 500 and 1000 of the age of
the Lord."</p></blockquote>

<p>This life, written in a large vellum folio, is preserved in
the Bodleian Library at Oxford and has never yet been

<p>The remains of Columcille, which after a three days' wake
were interred in Iona, were left undisturbed for close upon a
hundred years. They were afterwards disinterred and placed
within a splendid shrine of gold and silver, which, in due time,
became the prey of the marauding Norsemen. The belief is
very general that his remains found their last resting-place in
Downpatrick, along with those of St. Patrick and St. Brigit.
The present appearance of the spot where they are supposed
to lie, may be gathered from the indignant verses<a name="FNanchor_36_304" id="FNanchor_36_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_304" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> of a member
of a now defunct literary body, to which I had the honour of

This poem is taken from a Brussels MS., copied by Michael O'Clery for
Father Colgan, and by him accepted apparently as genuine. Some of it
may very well be so, only, as usual, it has been greatly altered and
modified in transcription, as may be seen from the above verse. (<i>See</i>
p. 288 of Reeves' "Adamnan.") Some of the verses are evidently interpelations,
but the Irish life in the Book of Lismore distinctly attributes to
him the verse which I have here given, going out of its way to quote it in
full, but the third line is a little different as quoted in the life: "ár is
lomlan aingeal bhfinn."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_275" id="Footnote_7_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_275"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> In Irish Dair-magh, "oak-plain." Columcille seems to have been
particularly fond of the oak, for his Irish life tells us that it was under
a great oak-tree that he resided while at Kells also. The writer adds,
"and it"&mdash;the great oak-tree&mdash;"remained till these latter times, when it
fell through the crash of a mighty wind. And a certain man took somewhat
of its bark to tan his shoes with. Now, when he did on the shoes,
he was smitten with leprosy from his sole to his crown." It is well known
to this day that it is unlucky, or worse, to touch a saint's tree. I have been
observing one that was, when in the last stage of decrepitude, blown down
a few years ago at the well of St. Aracht or Atracta, a female saint of
Connacht in the plains of Boyle; yet, though the people around are
nearly famished for want of fuel, not one twig of it has yet been
touched. In the Edinburgh MS. of Columcille's life we read how on
another occasion he made a hymn to arrest a fire that was consuming the
oak-wood, "and it is sung against every fire and against every thunder
from that time to this." (<i>See</i> Skene's "Celtic Scotland," vol. ii. pp. 468-507.)</p></div>

For the whole of this poem, in the form of a dialogue between Cormac
and Columcille, see p. 264 of Reeves' "Adamnan." It is very hard to say
how much or how little of these poems is really Columcille's. Colgan
was inclined to think them genuine. Of course, as we now have them,
the language is greatly modernised; but I am inclined to agree with Dr.
Healy, who judges them rather from internal than from linguistic
evidence; and while granting, of course, that they have been retouched
by later bards, adds, "but in our opinion they represent substantially
poems that were really written by the saint. They breathe his pious
spirit, his ardent love for nature, and his undying affection for his native
land. Although retouched, perhaps, by a later hand, they savour so
strongly of the true Columbian spirit that we are disposed to reckon them
amongst the genuine compositions of the saint." ("Ireland's Schools and
Scholars," p. 329.) "The older pieces here preserved," says Dr. Robert
Atkinson in his preface to the contents of the <i>facsimile</i> of the Book of
Leinster, "<i>and of whose genuineness and authenticity there seems no room
for doubt, ex. gr., the Poems of Colum Cille</i>, bear with them the marks of the
action of successive transcribers, whose desire to render them intelligible
has obscured the linguistic proofs of their age."</p></div>

chairs seen by him in heaven, even a chair of gold and a chair of silver

the carpenter's son, is the chair of gold for the greatness of his charity and
his mercy. Molaisse is the chair of silver because of his wisdom and his
piety. I myself am the chair of glass because of my affection, for I prefer
the Gaels to the men of the world, and Kinel Conall [his own tribe] to the
[other] Gaels, and the kindred of Lughid to the Kinel Conall." (Leabhar

codex known as the Cathach or "Battler," which was an heirloom
of the saint's descendants, the O'Donnells. It was always carried three
times round their army when they went to battle, on the breast of a cleric,
who, if he were free from mortal sin, was sure to bring them victory. The
Mac Robartaighs were the ancestral custodians of the holy relic, and
Cathbar O'Donnell, the chief of the race at the close of the eleventh century,
constructed an elaborately splendid shrine or cover for it. This
precious heirloom remained with the O'Donnells until Donal O'Donnell,
exiled in the cause of James II., brought it with him to the Continent and
fixed a new rim upon the casket with his name and date. It was recovered
from the Continent in 1802 by Sir Neal O'Donnell, and was opened
by Sir William Betham soon after. This would in the previous century
have been considered a deadly crime, for "it was not lawful" to open the
Cathach; as it was, Sir Neal's widow brought an action in the Court of
Chancery against Sir William Betham for daring to open it. There turned
out to be a decayed wooden box inside the casket, and inside this again
was a mass of vellum stuck together and hardened into a single lump. By
long steeping in water however, and other treatment, the various leaves
came asunder, and it was found that what it contained was really a Psalter,
written in Latin, in a "neat but hurried hand." Fifty-eight leaves remained,
containing from the 31st to the 106th Psalm, and an examination of
the text has shown that it really does contain a copy of the second revision
of the Psalter by St. Jerome, which helps to strengthen the belief that this
may have been the very book for which three thousand warriors fought
and fell in the Battle of Cooldrevna.</p></div>

"Altus," "the three battles which he had caused in Erin, viz., the battle of
Cúl-Rathain, between him and Comgall, contending for a church, viz.,
Ross Torathair; and the battle of Bealach-fheda of the weir of Clonard; and
the battle of Cúl Dremhne [Cooldrevna] in Connacht, and it was against
Diarmait Mac Cerball [the High-king], he fought them both." Keating's
account also agrees with this, but Reeves has shown that the two later
battles in which he was implicated probably took place after his exile.</p></div>

eye when I look back upon Erin. Upon Erin is my attention fixed, upon
Loch Leven [Lough Lene in West Meath], upon Linè [Moy-linny, near
Antrim], upon the land the Ultonians own, upon smooth Munster, upon
Meath.... Carry my benediction over the sea to the nobles of the Island

<h4>THE FIRST SCHOOLS OF CHRISTIAN IRELAND</h4>


<p>St. Patrick and the early Christians of the fifth century
spent much of their time and labour in the conversion of
pagans and the building of churches. Columcille and the
leading churchmen of the sixth century, on the other hand,
gave themselves up more to the foundation of monastic
institutions and the conduct of schools. They belonged to
what is well known in Irish ecclesiastical history as the second
Order of Saints. The first Order was composed of Patrick and
his associates, bishops filled with piety, founders of churches,
three hundred and fifty in number, mostly Franks, Romans,
and Britons, but with some Scots [<i>i.e.</i> Irish] also amongst them.
These worshipped, says the ancient "Catalogue of the Saints,"
one head&mdash;Christ, and followed one leader&mdash;Patrick. They
had one tonsure, one celebration of the Mass, and one Easter.
They mixed freely in the society of women, because they feared
not the wind of temptation, and this first Order of Saints, as it
is called, is reckoned by the Irish to have lasted during four
reigns.</p>

<p>The next Order of Saints had few bishops but many priests,
this was the order to which Columcille belonged, and most of
the saints who founded the great schools of Ireland which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the following century became so flourishing and spread their
fame throughout Europe, as those of Ciaran and Finnian and
Brendan, and a score of others. This Order shunned all
association with women, and would not have them in their
monasteries.<a name="FNanchor_1_306" id="FNanchor_1_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_306" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> These saints whilst worshipping God as their
head, and celebrating one Easter and having one tonsure, yet
had different rites for celebrating, and different rules for living.
The rite with which they celebrated Mass they are said to
have secured from the British saints, St. David, St. Gildas, and
others. They also lasted for four reigns, or, roughly speaking,
during the last three quarters of the sixth century.</p>

<p>After these came what is called the third Order of Saints who
appear in their time to have been pre-eminent amongst the
other Christians, and to have been mostly anchorites, who
lived on herbs and supported themselves by such alms as they
were given, despising all things earthly and all things fleshly.
They observed Easter differently, they had different tonsures,
they had different rules of life, and different rites for celebrating
Mass. They are said to have numbered about a
hundred and to have lasted down to the time of the great
plague in 664.</p>

<p>This third Order, says the writer of the "Catalogue of Saints,"
who gives their names, was holy, the second holier, but the first
Order was most holy. "The first glowed like the sun in the
fervour of their charity, the second cast a pale radiance like the
moon, the third shone like the aurora. These three Orders the
blessed Patrick foreknew, enlightened by heavenly wisdom,
when in prophetic vision he saw at first all Ireland ablaze, and
afterwards only the mountains on fire, and at last saw lamps
lit in the valleys."</p>

<p>By the middle of the sixth century Ireland had been honeycombed
from shore to shore with schools, monasteries, colleges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and foundations of all kinds belonging to the Christian community,
and books had multiplied to a marvellous extent. At
the same time the professional bards flourished in such numbers
that Keating says that "nearly a third of the men of Ireland
belonged, about that period, to the poetic order." Omitting for
the present the consideration of the bards and the non-Christian
literature of poem and saga&mdash;mostly anonymous&mdash;which they
produced, we must, take a rapid survey of some of the most
important of the Christian schools, whose pious professors,
whose number, and whose learning, secured for Ireland the
title of the Island of Saints. We have already seen how the
three patron saints of Ireland established their schools in
Armagh, Kildare, and Iona, and their example was followed
by hundreds.</p>

<p>St. Enda, the son of a king of Oriel, after having studied at
some school in Great Britain (probably with St. Ninian&mdash;who
is said to have been himself an Irishman&mdash;at his noble
monastery of Candida Casa in Galloway, built about the
year 400), and after travelling through various parts of
Ireland, settled down finally about the year 483 in the
rocky and inaccessible island of Aran Mór, and was the
first of those holy men who have won for it the appellation
of Aran of the Saints. "One hundred and twenty-seven
saints sleep in the little square yard around Killeany
Church"<a name="FNanchor_2_307" id="FNanchor_2_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_307" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> alone, and we are told that the countless numbers
of saints who have mingled their clay with the holy soil of
Aran will never be known until the day of Judgment.
Here most of the saints of the second Order repaired sooner or
later, to be instructed by, or to hold converse with St. Enda;
amongst them Brendan the Voyager, whose wanderings, under
the title of <i>Navigatio Brendani</i>, became so well known in later
ages to all mediæval Europe. To him also came St. Finnian
of Clonard, who was himself celebrated in later days as the
"Tutor of the Saints of Erin." From the remote north came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Finnian of Moville, Columcille's first teacher, and Ciaran, the
carpenter's son, the illustrious founder of Clonmacnois. St.
Jarlath of Tuam was there too, with St. Carthach the elder,
of Lismore, and with St. Keevin of Glendalough. St.
Columcille<a name="FNanchor_3_308" id="FNanchor_3_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_308" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> himself was amongst Enda's visitors, and tore
himself away with the utmost difficulty, solacing himself by
recourse to the Irish muse as was his wont&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Another early school was that founded by St. Finnian at
Cluain Eraird, better known under its corrupt form Clonard,
a spot hard by the river Boyne, to which students from both
north and south resorted in great numbers. Finnian, who
was of the Clanna Rury, or Irian race, had been baptized by
Bishop Fortchern, who&mdash;so quickly did the Christian cause
progress&mdash;was a grandson of King Laeghaire, who withstood
St. Patrick. This Fortchern, too, like Brigit's favourite
bishop, was a skilled artificer in bronze and metal, a calling
to which many of the early saints evinced a strong bias.
Clonard even during Finnian's lifetime became a great school,
and three thousand students are said to have been gathered
round it, amongst them the so-called Twelve Apostles of Erin.
These are Ciaran of Clonmacnois and Ciaran of Saigher, who
is patron saint of Ossory; Brendan of Birr, the "prophet,"
and Brendan of Clonfert, the "navigator"; Columba of
Tir-da-glass and Columcille; Mobhí of Glasnevin and&mdash;<i>infaustum
nomen!</i>&mdash;Rodan of Lothra or Lorrha; Senanus of
Iniscathy, whose name is known to the lovers of the poet
Moore; Ninnidh of Loch Erne; Lasserian, and St. Cainnech
of Kilkenny, known in Scotland as Kenneth, and second in
that country only to St. Columcille and St. Brigit in popularity.
The school of Clonard was founded about the year 520, when,
to quote the rather jingling hymn from St. Finnian's office&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Reversus in Clonardiam</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ad cathedram lecturæ</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Opponit diligentiam</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ad studium scripturæ."</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>The numbers who attended his teaching are given in another
verse&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Trium virorum millium</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sorte fit doctor humilis,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Verbi his fudit fluvium</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ut fons emanans rivulis."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Like all the other early Irish foundations which attained to
wealth and dignity before the ninth century, Clonard suffered
in proportion to its fame. It was after that date plundered and
destroyed twelve times, and was fourteen times burnt down
either wholly or in part. That being so, it is not much to be
wondered at that there only remains a single surviving literary
work of this school, which is the "Mystical Interpretation of
the Ancestry of our Lord Jesus Christ," by St. Aileran the
Wise, one of Finnian's successors, who died of the great plague
in 664. This piece, like so many others, was found in the
Swiss monastery of St. Gall, whither it had been brought by
some monks from Ireland. The editors who printed it for the
Benedictines in the seventeenth century say that, although the
writer did not belong to their Order, they publish it because
he "unfolded the meaning of sacred scripture with so much
learning and ingenuity that every student of the sacred
volume, and especially preachers of the Divine Word, will
regard the publication as most acceptable." The learned
editors could have hardly paid the Irish writer a higher
compliment. "A Short Moral Explanation of the Sacred
Names" is another still existing fragment of Aileran's, and
"whether we consider the style of the latinity, the learning,
or the ingenuity of the writer," says Dr. Healy, "it is equally
marvellous and equally honourable to the school of Clonard."
Aileran is said to have also written lives of St. Patrick, St.
Brigit, and St. Fechin of Fore, and to be the original author
of a litany, part Irish, part Latin, preserved in the Yellow
Book of Lecan.</p>

<p>Another great Irish college was Clonfert on the Shannon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
founded about the year 556 by Brendan the Navigator, who,
like Finnian, came of the Irian race, being descended from
Fergus mac Roy.<a name="FNanchor_5_310" id="FNanchor_5_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_310" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He was born towards the close of the
fifth century, and his school, too, became very famous, having,
it is said, produced as many as three thousand monks. The
influence of the <i>Navigatio Brendani</i>, by whomsoever written,
was immense, and was felt through all Europe, so that in
many of the great continental libraries good MS. copies of
it, sometimes very ancient, may be found.<a name="FNanchor_6_311" id="FNanchor_6_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_311" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But perhaps
Brendan's grand-nephew and pupil may have indirectly influenced
European literature in a still more important manner.
This was Fursa, afterwards St. Fursa, whose visions were
known all over Ireland, Great Britain, and France. There
can be no doubt about the substantial accuracy of St. Fursa's
life, for Bede himself, who dedicates a good deal of space to
Fursa's visions,<a name="FNanchor_7_312" id="FNanchor_7_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_312" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> refers to it. It must have been written within
ten or fifteen years after his death, because it refers to the
plague and the great eclipse of the sun which <i>happened last
year</i>, that is 664. Now Dante was acquainted with Bede's
writings, for he expressly mentions him, and Bede's account
of Fursa and Fursa's own life may have been familiar to him,
and furnished him with the groundwork of part of the Divine
Comedy of which it seems a kind of prototype.<a name="FNanchor_8_313" id="FNanchor_8_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_313" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>Brendan's own adventures and his view of hell, which he
was shown by the devil, may also have been known to Dante.
Brendan prepared three vessels with thirty men in each, some
clerics, some laymen, and with these, says his Irish life in
the Book of Lismore, he sailed to seek the Promised Land,
which, evidently influenced by the old pagan traditions of
Moy Mell<a name="FNanchor_9_314" id="FNanchor_9_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_314" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and Hy Brassil, he expected to find as an island
in the Western Sea, and so says his Irish life poetically&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Brendan, son of Finnlug, sailed over the wave-voice of the
strong-maned sea, and over the storm of the green-sided waves,
and over the mouths of the marvellous awful bitter ocean, where
they saw the multitude of the furious red-mouthed monsters with
abundance of the great sea-whales. And they found beautiful
marvellous islands, yet they tarried not therein."</p></blockquote>

<p>Like Sindbad in the Arabian tales,<a name="FNanchor_10_315" id="FNanchor_10_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_315" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> they land upon the back
of a great whale as if it had been solid land. There they
celebrated Easter. They endured much peril from the sea.
"On a certain day, as they were on the marvellous ocean"&mdash;this
adjective is strongly indicative of the spirit in which the
Celt regards the works of nature&mdash;"they beheld the deep bitter
streams and the vast black whirlpools of the strong-maned sea,
and in them their vessels were being constrained to founder
because of the greatness of the storm." Brendan, however,
cried to the sea, "It is enough for thee, O mighty sea, to
drown me alone, but let this folk escape thee," and on hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
his cry the sea grew calm. It was after this that Brendan got
a view of hell.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On a certain day," says the Irish Life, "that they were on the
sea, the devil came in a form old, awful, hideous, foul, hellish, and
sat on the rail of the vessel before Brendan, and none of them saw
him save Brendan alone. Brendan asked him why he had come
before his proper time, that is, before the time of the great resurrection.
'For this have I come,' said the devil, 'to seek my punishment
in the deep closes of this black, dark sea.' Brendan inquired of him,
'What is this, where is that infernal place?' 'Sad is that,' said the
devil; 'no one can see it and remain alive afterwards.' Howbeit the
devil there revealed the gate of hell to Brendan, and Brendan beheld
that rough, hot prison full of stench, full of flame, full of filth, full of
the camps of the poisonous demons, full of wailing and screaming
and hurt and sad cries and great lamentations and moaning and
handsmiting of the sinful folks, and a gloomy, mournful life in hearts
of pain, in igneous prisons, in streams of the rows of eternal fire, in
the cup of eternal sorrow and death, without limit, without end; in
black, dark swamps, in fonts of heavy flame, in abundance of woe
and death and torments, and fetters, and feeble wearying combats,
with the awful shouting of the poisonous demons, in a night ever-dark,
ever-cold, ever-stinking, ever-foul, ever-misty, ever-harsh,
ever-long, ever-stifling, deadly, destructive, gloomy, fiery-haired, of
the loathsome bottom of hell. On sides of mountains of eternal
fire, without rest, without stay, were hosts of demons dragging the
sinners into prisons ... black demons; stinking fires; streams of
poison; cats scratching; hounds rending; dogs baying; demons
yelling; stinking lakes; great swamps; dark pits; deep glens; high
mountains; hard crags;... winds bitter, wintry; snow frozen,
ever-dropping; flakes red, fiery; faces base, darkened; demons
swift, greedy; tortures vast, various."<a name="FNanchor_11_316" id="FNanchor_11_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_316" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This is one of the earliest attempts in literature at the pourtrayal
of an Inferno.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>After a seven-years' voyage Brendan returned home to his
own country without having found his Earthly Paradise, and
his people and his folic at home "brought him," says the Irish
Life, "treasures and gifts as if they were giving them to
God"!</p>

<p>His foster-mother St. Ita now advised him not to put forth
in search of that glorious land in those dead stained skins which
formed his currachs, for it was a holy land he sought, and he
should look for it in wooden vessels. Then Brendan built
himself "a great marvellous vessel, distinguished and huge."
He first sailed to Aran to consort with St. Enda, but after a
month he heaved anchor and sailed once more into the
West.</p>

<p>He reaches the Isle of Paradise after many adventures, and is
invited on shore by an old man "without any human raiment,
but all his body full of bright white feathers like a dove
or a sea-mew, and it was almost the speech of an angel that
he had." "O ye toilsome men," he said, "O hallowed
pilgrims, O folk that entreat the heavenly rewards, O ever-weary
life expecting this land, stay a little now from your
labour." The land is described in terms that forcibly record
the delights of the pagan Elysium of Moy Mell, and prove how
intimately the Brendan legend is bound up with primitive pre-Christian
mythological beliefs. "The delightful fields of the
land" are described as "radiant, famous, lovable,"&mdash;"a land
odorous, flower-smooth, blessed, a land many-melodied, musical,
shouting-for-joy, unmournful." "Happy," said the old man,
"shall he be with well-deservingness and with good deeds,
whom Brandan, son of Finnlug, shall call into union with him
on that side to inhabit for ever and ever the island whereon we
stand."</p>

<p>But better known&mdash;at least in ecclesiastical history&mdash;than
even St. Brendan, is St. Cummian, surnamed "fada" or the
Long, who was one of his successors in the school of Clonfert,
and who perished in or a little before the great plague of 664.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
There are two hymns, one by himself in Latin,<a name="FNanchor_12_317" id="FNanchor_12_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_317" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and one in
Irish by his tutor, Colman Ua Cluasaigh [Clooasy] of Cork,
preserved in the "Liber Hymnorum." But his great achievement
was his celebrated letter on the Paschal question addressed
to his friend Segienus, the abbot of Iona. The question of
when to celebrate Easter day was one which long sundered
the British and Irish Churches from the rest of Europe, and
has, as students of ecclesiastical history know, given rise to all
sorts of conjectures as to the independence of these churches.
The charge against the Irish was that they celebrated Easter
on any day from the fourteenth to the twentieth day of the
moon, even on the fourteenth if it should happen to be Sunday,
but the fourteenth was a Jewish festival and the Council of Nice
had, in 325, declared it to be unlawful to celebrate the Christian
Easter on a Jewish festival.<a name="FNanchor_13_318" id="FNanchor_13_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_318" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The Irish had obtained their own
doctrine of Easter from the East, through Gaul, which was
largely open to Eastern influence; also the Irish used the old
Roman cycle of 84 years, not the newer and more correct
Alexandrian one of 19 years. The consequence was the
scandal of having different Churches of Christendom celebrating
Easter on different days, and some mourning when others were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
feasting, a scandal which the Epistle of Cummian was designed
to put an end to.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I call this letter," says Professor G. Stokes,<a name="FNanchor_14_319" id="FNanchor_14_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_319" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> "a marvellous composition
because of the vastness of its learning; it quotes besides the
Scriptures and Latin authors, Greek writers like Origen, and Cyril,
Pachomius the head and reformer of Egyptian monasticism, and
Damascius the last of the celebrated neo-Platonic philosophers of
Athens, who lived about the year 500, and wrote all his works in
Greek. Cummian discusses the calendars of the Macedonians,
Hebrews, and Copts, giving us the Hebrew, Greek, and Egyptian
names of months and cycles, and tells us that he had been sent as
one of a deputation of learned men a few years before to ascertain
the practice of the Church of Rome. When they came to Rome
they lodged in one hospital with a Greek and a Hebrew, an Egyptian,
and a Scythian, who told them that the whole world celebrated the
Roman and not the Irish Easter."</p></blockquote>

<p>Cummian throughout this letter displays the true spirit of a
scholar, he humbly apologises for his presumption in addressing
such holy men, and calls God to witness that he is actuated by
no spirit of pride or contempt for others. When the new
cycle of 532 years was first introduced into Ireland he did not
at once accept it, but held his peace and took no side in the
matter, because he did not think himself wiser than the
Hebrews, Greeks, and Latins, nor did he venture to disdain
the food he had not yet tasted. So he retired for a whole year
into the study of the question, to examine for himself the facts
of history, the nature of the various cycles in use, and the
testimony of Scripture.</p>

<p>There is another book, "De Mensura P&#339;nitentiarum,"
ascribed to Cummian and printed in Migne; and there is a
poem on his death by his tutor, St. Colman, who was carried
off by the same plague a short time after him.<a name="FNanchor_15_320" id="FNanchor_15_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_320" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The great institution presided over by St. Cummian was
flourishing in full vigour at the time of the first incursions of
the Northmen. It is frequently mentioned in the Irish Annals
as a place of note and learning. Turgesius the Dane, attracted
by so fair a booty, promptly plundered and burnt it to the
ground. Again and again it was rebuilt, and again and again
the same fate befell it. The monastery and the school
survived, however, until the coming of the Normans, and the
"Four Masters" under the year 1170 record the death of one
of its teachers, Cormac O'Lumlini, whom they pathetically
designate "the remnant of the sages of Erin," for by this time
Clonfert had been six times burnt and four times plundered.</p>

<p>Even a greater school, however, than Clonfert, was that
founded by St. Ciaran [Keeran], the carpenter's son, beside a
curve in the Shannon, at Clonmacnois, not far from Athlone,
about the year 544. He had himself been educated by St.
Finnian of Clonard, and he died at the early age of thirty-three,
immediately after laying the foundations of what was
destined to become the greatest Christian college in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_16_321" id="FNanchor_16_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_321" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The monastery and cells of St. Ciaran rapidly grew into a
city, to which students flocked from far and near. In one
sense the College of Clonmacnois had an advantage over all its
rivals, for it belonged to no one race or clan. Its abbots and
teachers were drawn from many different tribes, and situated
as it was, in almost the centre of the island, all the great races,
Erimonians, Eberians, Irians, and Ithians, resorted to it
impartially, and it became a real university. There the
O'Conors, kings of Connacht, had their own separate church;
there the Southern Ui Neill reared apart their own cathedral;
there the MacDermots, princes of Moylurg, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
O'Kellys, kings of Hy Mainy, had each their own mortuary
chapels; there the Southerns built one round tower, the
O'Rorkes another; and there too the Mac Carthys of Munster
had a burial-place. Who, even at this day, has not heard of
the glories of Clonmacnois, of its ruins, its graves, its crosses;
of its churchyard, which possesses a greater variety of sculptured
and decorated stones than perhaps all the rest of Ireland
put together, and of which the Irish poet beautifully sang so
long ago&mdash;</p>

<p>Some of the most distinguished scholars of Ireland, if not of
Europe, were educated at Clonmacnois, including Alcuin, the
most learned man at the French court, who remembered his
alma mater so affectionately that he extracted from King
Charles of France a gift of fifty shekels of silver, to which he
added fifty more of his own, and sent them to the brotherhood
of Clonmacnois as a gift, with a quantity of olive oil for the
Irish bishops. His affectionate letter to "his blessed master
and pious father" Colgan, chief professor at Clonmacnois, is
still extant.</p>

<p>This Colgu, or Colgan, himself wrote a book in Irish, called
"The Besom of Devotion," which appears to be now lost.
A litany of his still remains. The great eleventh-century
annalist, Tighearnach, was an alumnus of Clonmacnois. So,
too, was the reputed author of the "Chronicon Scotorum,"
O'Malone, in 1123. The Annals of Clonmacnois was one
of the books in the hands of the "Four Masters," but it is now
lost, and a different book called by the same name (the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of which has also perished) was translated into English by
Macgeoghegan in 1627.<a name="FNanchor_18_323" id="FNanchor_18_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_323" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The celebrated Leabhar na h-Uidhre
[Lowar na Heera] or "Book of the Dun Cow," compiled
about the year 1100, emanated from this centre of learning.
Like Clonfert, and every other home of Irish civilisation, the
city of Clonmacnois fell a prey to the barbarians. The Northmen
plundered it or burnt it, or both, on ten separate occasions.
Turgesius, their leader, set up his wife Ota as a kind of
priestess to deliver oracles from its high altar;<a name="FNanchor_19_324" id="FNanchor_19_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_324" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and some of
the Irish themselves, reduced to a state of barbarism by the
horrors of the period, laid their sacrilegious hands upon its
holy places; and afterwards the English of Athlone stepped in
and completed its destruction. It now remains only a ruin and
a name.</p>

<p>Another very celebrated school was that of Bangor, on
Belfast Loch, founded by Comgall, the friend of Columcille,
between 550 and 560. It soon became crowded with scholars,
and next to Armagh it was certainly the greatest school of the
northern province, and produced men of the highest eminence
at home and abroad. Its fame reached far across the sea. St.
Bernard called it "a noble institution, which was inhabited by
many thousands of monks;" and Joceline of Furness, in the
twelfth century, called it "a fruitful vine breathing the odour
of salvation, whose offshoots extended not only over all Ireland,
but far beyond the seas into foreign countries, and filled many
lands with its abounding fruitfulness."</p>

<p>The most distinguished of Bangor's sons of learning were
Columbanus, the evangeliser of portions of Burgundy and Lombardy;
St. Gall, the evangeliser of Switzerland; Dungal, the
astronomer; and later on, in the twelfth century, Malachy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
O'Morgair, who, though not known as an author, distinguished
himself in the province of Church discipline.</p>

<p>The lives of St. Columbanus and of St. Gall belong rather
to foreign than to Irish history, but we may glance at them
again in another place. Dungal, poet, astronomer, and
theologian, was also like them, for a time, an exile. His identity
is uncertain; the "Four Masters" mention twenty-two persons
of the same name between the years 744 and 1015, but his
Irish nationality is certain, and he calls himself "Hibernicus
exul" in his poem addressed to his patron Charlemagne. He
appears to have died in the Irish monastery at Bobbio, in North
Italy, to which he left his library, and amongst other books the
celebrated Antiphonary of Bangor, his possession of which seems
to warrant us in supposing that Bangor was his original college.
He appears to have been a close friend of Charlemagne's, and
in 811 he wrote him his celebrated letter, explanatory of the
two solar eclipses which had taken place the year before. The
emperor could apparently find at his court no other astronomer
of sufficient learning to explain the phenomena. Later on we
find Dungal, at the request of Lothaire, Charlemagne's grandson,
opening a school at Pavia to civilise the Lombards, to
which institution great numbers of students flocked from
every quarter. Dungal may, in fact, be regarded as the
founder of the University of Pavia. His greatest effort whilst
in Pavia was his work against the Iconoclasts. Dungal's attack
upon the cultured Spanish bishop, Claudius, who championed
them, as it was the first, so it appears to have been the ablest
blow struck; and Western iconoclasm seemed to have for the
time received a mortal wound from his hand.<a name="FNanchor_20_325" id="FNanchor_20_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_325" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Besides his long
eulogy on his friend and patron Charlemagne, several other smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
poems of his survive, showing him to have been&mdash;like almost
all Irishmen of that date&mdash;no mere pedant and student.</p>

<p>Like almost all the more famous and attractive of the Irish
colleges, Bangor suffered fearfully from the attacks of the
northern pirates, who, according to St. Bernard, slew there as
many as nine hundred monks. "Not a cross, not even a
stone," says Dr. Healy, "now remains to mark the site of the
famous monastery, whose crowded cloisters for a thousand
years overlooked the pleasant islets and broad waters of Inver
Becne." It has shared the fate of its compeers:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>etiam periere ruinæ.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>It would prove too tedious to enumerate the other Irish
colleges which dotted the island in the sixth and seventh
centuries. The most remarkable of them besides those that
I have mentioned were Moville, at the head of Loch Cuan
or Strangford Lough, in the County Down, founded by St.
Finnian, who was born before 500, and who afterwards became
known as Frigidius, Bishop of Lucca, in Switzerland. Colman,
whose hymn is preserved in the "Liber Hymnorum," and
Marianus Scotus, the Chronicler, were <i>alumni</i> of Moville.</p>

<p>Cluain Eidnech, or Clonenagh, the "Ivy Meadow," was
founded by St. Fintan, near Maryborough, in the present
Queen's County. Angus the Culdee, who with its Abbot
Maelruain is said to have composed the Martyrology of
Tallaght prior to 792, was its greatest ornament. Of his
Irish works we shall have more to say later on. Clonenagh
suffered so much from the Northmen, that its great foundation
had already in the twelfth century dwindled to a parochial
church; in the nineteenth it is a green mound.</p>

<p>Glendalough, founded by the celebrated St. Kevin,<a name="FNanchor_21_326" id="FNanchor_21_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_326" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> became
also a college of much note. St. Moling, to whom a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
number of Irish poems<a name="FNanchor_22_327" id="FNanchor_22_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_327" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> are ascribed, was one of his successors
in the seventh century, and his life seems to have taken
peculiar hold upon the imagination of the populace, for he has
more poems&mdash;many of them evident forgeries&mdash;attributed to
him than we find ascribed to any of the saints except to
Columcille; and he has a place amongst the four great
prophets of Erin.<a name="FNanchor_23_328" id="FNanchor_23_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_328" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It was he who procured the remission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the Boru tribute from King Finnachta about the year 693.
Glendalough was plundered and destroyed by the Danes five
times over, within a period of thirty years, yet it to some
extent recovered itself, and the great St. Laurence O'Toole,
who was Archbishop of Dublin at the coming of the Normans,
had been there educated.</p>

<p>Lismore, the great college of the south-east, was founded by
St. Carthach in the beginning of the seventh century, who left
behind him, according to O'Curry, a monastic rule of 580
lines of Irish verse.<a name="FNanchor_24_329" id="FNanchor_24_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_329" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Cathal, or Cathaldus, born in the
beginning of the seventh century, who afterwards became
bishop and patron saint of Tarentum, in Italy, was a student,
and perhaps professor in this college. The office of St. Cathaldus
states that Gauls, Angles, Irish, and Teutons, and very
many people of neighbouring nations came to hear his lectures
at Lismore, and Morini's life of him expresses in poetic terms
the tradition of Lismore's greatness.<a name="FNanchor_25_330" id="FNanchor_25_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_330" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> St. Cuanna, another
member of Lismore, was probably the author of the Book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Cuanach, now lost, but often quoted in the Annals of
Ulster. He died in 650, and the book is not quoted after
the year 628, which makes it more than probable that he was
the author. Lismore was burnt down by the Danes, but
recovered itself in the general revival of native institutions that
took place prior to the conquest of the Anglo-Normans.
However, when these latter came upon the Irish stage it fared
ill with Lismore. Strongbow, indeed, was bought off from
burning its churches in 1173 by a great sum of money, but in
the following year his son, in spite of this, plundered the place.
Four years later the English forces again attacked it, plundered
it, and set it on fire. In 1207 the whole town and all about it
was finally consumed, so that at the present day not a vestige
remains behind of its schools, its cloisters, or its twenty
churches.</p>

<p>Cork college was founded by St. Finnbarr towards the
end of the sixth century. One of its professors, Colman
O'Cluasaigh, who died in 664, wrote the curious Irish hymn
or prayer mixed with Latin, preserved in the Book of
Hymns.<a name="FNanchor_26_331" id="FNanchor_26_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_331" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The place was burned four times between 822 and
840, but in the twelfth century the ancient monastery which
had fallen into decay was rebuilt by Cormac Mac Carthy, king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
of Munster, and builder of the celebrated Cormac's Chapel
at Cashel.</p>

<p>The school of Ross was founded by St. Fachtna for the
Ithian tribes<a name="FNanchor_27_332" id="FNanchor_27_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_332" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of Corca Laidhi [Cor-ka-lee] in South-west
Munster. Ross is frequently referred to in the Annals up to
the tenth century. There is extant an interesting geographical
poem in Irish, of 136 lines, written by one of the
teachers there in the tenth century, and apparently intended
as a kind of simple text to be learned by heart by the students.<a name="FNanchor_28_333" id="FNanchor_28_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_333" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Ross was plundered by the Danes in 840, but appears to have
been flourishing until North-west Munster was laid waste by
the Anglo-Normans under FitzStephen, after which no more is
heard of its schools or colleges.</p>

<p>Innisfallen was founded upon an exquisite site on the lower
lake of Killarney by St. Finan.<a name="FNanchor_29_334" id="FNanchor_29_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_334" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The well-known "Annals
of Innisfallen," preserved in the Bodleian Library, were
probably written by Maelsuthain [Calvus Perennis] O'Carroll,
the "soul-friend" of Brian Boru, who inserted the famous
entry in the Book of Armagh.<a name="FNanchor_30_335" id="FNanchor_30_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_335" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It is probable that Brian
himself was also educated there. This monastery, owing to
its secure retreat in the Kerry mountains, appears to have
remained unplundered by the Norsemen, and to have been
accounted "a paradise and a secure sanctuary."</p>

<p>Iniscaltra is a beautiful island in the south-west angle of
Loch Derg, between Galway and Clare, still famous for its
splendid round tower. It was here Columba of Terryglass,
who died in 552, established a school and monastery which
became so famous that in the life of St. Senan seven ships are
mentioned as arriving at the mouth of the Shannon crowded with
students for Iniscaltra. It was this Columba who, when asked
by one of his disciples why the birds that frequented the island
were not afraid of him, made the somewhat dramatic answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
"Why should they fear me? am I not a bird myself, for my
soul always flies to heaven as they fly through the sky."
Columba had a celebrated successor called Caimin, who died in
653. Ussher, who calls him St. Caminus, tells us that part of
his Psalter was extant in his own time, and that he had himself
seen it "having a collation of the Hebrew text placed on the
upper part of each page, and with brief scholia added on the
exterior margin."<a name="FNanchor_31_336" id="FNanchor_31_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_336" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>A great number of lesser monastic institutions and schools
seem to have existed alongside of these more famous ones, and
it is hardly too much to say that during the sixth, seventh,
eighth, and perhaps ninth centuries Ireland had caught and
held aloft the torch of learning in the lampadia of mankind,
and procured for herself the honourable title of the island of
saints and scholars.</p>

out a large number of close parallels between Fursa's vision and Dante's
poem which seem altogether too striking to be fortuitous. (<i>See</i> vol. i.
pp. 115-120.) There are a poem and a litany attributed to St. Fursa in
the MS. H. 1. 11. in Trinity College, Dublin. The visions of Purgatory
seen by Dryhthelm, a monk of Melrose, as recorded by Bede, which are
later than St. Fursa's vision, are conceived very much in the same style,
only are much more doctrinal in their purgatorial teaching. "Tracing
the course of thought upwards," says Sir Francis Palgrave ("History of
Normandy and England"), "we have no difficulty in deducing the poetic
genealogy of Dante's 'Inferno' to the Milesian Fursæus."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_17_322" id="Footnote_17_322"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_322"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Thus admirably translated by my friend Mr. Rolleston in "Poems
and Ballads of Young Ireland," Dublin, 1888, a little volume which seems
to have been the precursor of a considerable literary movement in Ireland.
Literally: "The city of Ciaran of Clonmacnois, a dewy-bright red-rose
town, of its royal seed, of lasting fame, the hosts in the pure-streamed
peaceful town. The nobles of the clan of Conn are in the flag-laid brown-sloped
churchyard, a knot or a branch above each body and a fair correct
name in Ogam. The sons of Cairbré over the seven territories, the seven
great princes from Tara, many a sheltering standard on a field of battle is
with the people of Ciaran's Plain of Crosses. The men of Teffia, the
tribes of Breagh were buried beneath the clay of Cluain[macnois]. The
valiant and hospitable are yonder beneath the sod, the race of Creidé and
the Clan Conaill. Numerous are the sons of Conn of the Battles, with red
clay and turf covering them, many a blue eye and white limb under the
earth of Clan Colman's tomb." The first verses run in modern spelling
thus:
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Cáthair Chiaráin Chluain-mic-Nóis</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Baile drucht-solas, dearg-rois.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Da shíl rioghraidh is buan bládh</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Agus ainm caomh ceart Oghaim."</span><br />
</p>
<p>
The clan of Conn here mentioned are principally the Ui Neill and their
correlatives. Teffia is something equivalent to Longford, and Breagh to
Meath. Clan Creidé are the O'Conors of Connacht, and the Clan Colman
principally means the O'Melaughlins and their kin. "Colman mor, a quo
Clann Cholmáin ie Maoileachlain cona fflaithibh" (Mac Firbis MS. Book
of Genealogies, p. 161 of O'Curry's transcript). Colman was the brother
of King Diarmuid, who was slain in 552.</p></div>

or cover, deposited in Trinity College, Dublin, in the last century by the
Kavanaghs of Borris. Giraldus Cambrensis classes Moling as a prophet
with Merlin, and as a saint with Patrick and Columba. One of the
prophecies assigned to him is given by O'Curry, MS. Mat., p. 427. The
oldest copy of any of Moling's poems is in the monastery of St. Paul in
Carinthia, contained in a MS. originally brought from Augia Dives, or
Reichenau. It is in the most perfect metre, and runs:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">"Is en immo niada sás</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Is nau tholl diant eslinn guas,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Is lestar fás, is crann crín</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Nach digni toil ind rig tuas."</span><br />
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">("He is a bird round which a trap closes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is a leaky bark in weakness of peril,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is an empty vessel, he is a withered tree</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who doth not do the will of the King above.")</span><br />
</p>
<p>
<i>I.e.</i>, "Is eán um a n-iadhann sás / is nau (long) thollta darb' éislinn guais.
Is leastar fas (folamh) is crann crion, [an te] nach ndeanann toil an righ
shuas."
</p>
<p>
The poem is also given in the Book of Leinster, and contains eight
verses. One would perhaps have expected the third line to run, "is crann
crín is lestar fás." The St. Paul MS., which is of the eighth century, contains
two of Molling's poems, and they scarcely differ in wording or
orthography from copies in MSS. six hundred years later.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_23_328" id="Footnote_23_328"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_328"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> Patrick, Columcille, and Berchan of Clonsast, are the others. Even
the English settlers had heard of their fame. Baron Finglas, writing in
Henry VIII.'s reign, says, "The four saints, St. Patrick, St. Columb, St.
Braghane [<i>i.e.</i>, Berchan], and St. Moling, which many hundred years
agone made prophecy that Englishmen should have conquered Ireland,
and said that the said Englishmen should keep their owne laws, and as
soon as they should leave, and fall to Irish order, then they should decay,
the experience whereof is proved true." (From Ryan's "History and
Antiquities of the co. Carlow," p. 93.) A still more curious allusion to the
four Irish prophets is one in the Book of Howth, a small vellum folio of
the sixteenth century, written in thirteen different hands, published in the
Calendar of State Papers. "Men say," recounts the anonymous writer,
"that the Irishmen had four prophets in their time, Patrick, Marten [<i>sic</i>],
Brahen [<i>i.e.</i>, Berchan], and Collumkill. Whosoever hath books in Irish
written every of them speak of the fight of this conquest, and saith that
long strife and oft fighting shall be for this land, and the land shall be
harried and stained with great slaughter of men, but the Englishmen fully
shall have the mastery a little before doomsday, and that land shall be
from sea to sea i-castled and fully won, but the Englishmen shall be after
that well feeble in the land and disdained; so Barcan [Berchan] saith:
that through a king shall come out of the wild mountains of St. Patrick's,
that much people shall slew and afterwards break a castle in the wooden
of Affayle, with that the Englishmen of Ireland shall be destroyed by
that." The prophecy that the Englishmen fully shall have the mastery a
little before Doomsday is amusingly equivocal!</p></div>

<h4>THEIR FAME AND TEACHING</h4>


<p>It is very difficult to say what was exactly the curriculum of
the early Irish colleges, and how far they were patronised by
laymen. Without doubt their original design was to propagate
a more perfect knowledge of the Scriptures and of
theological learning in general, but it is equally certain that
they must have, almost from the very first, taught the heathen
classics and the Irish language side by side with the Scriptures
and theology. There is no other possible way of accounting
for the admirable scholarship of the men whom they turned
out, and for their skill in Latin and often also in Irish poetry.
Virgil, Ovid, Terence, and most of the Latin poets must have
been widely taught and read. "It is sufficient," says M.
d'Arbois de Jubainville, talking of Columbanus who was born
in 543, and who was educated at Bangor, on Belfast Loch,
"to glance at his writings, immediately to recognise his
marvellous superiority over Gregory of Tours and the Gallo-Romans
of his time. He lived in close converse with the
classical authors, as later on did the learned men of the sixteenth
century, whose equal he certainly is not, but of whom he
seems a sort of precursor." From the sixth to the sixteenth
century is a long leap, and no higher eulogium could be passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
upon the scholarship of Columbanus and the training given by
his Irish college.<a name="FNanchor_1_337" id="FNanchor_1_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_337" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> All the studies of the time appear to have
been taught in them through the medium of the Irish language,
not merely theology but arithmetic, rhetoric, poetry, hagiography,
natural science as then understood, grammar, chronology,
astronomy, Greek, and even Hebrew.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The classic tradition," sums up M. Darmesteter, "to all appearances
dead in Europe, burst out into full flower in the Isle of Saints,
and the Renaissance began in Ireland 700 years before it was known
in Italy. During three centuries Ireland was the asylum of the
higher learning which took sanctuary there from the uncultured
states of Europe. At one time Armagh, the religious capital of
Christian Ireland, was the metropolis of civilisation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ireland," says Babington in his "Fallacies of Race Theories,"<a name="FNanchor_2_338" id="FNanchor_2_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_338" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
"had been admitted into Christendom and to some measure of
culture only in the fifth century. At that time Gaul and Italy
enjoyed to the full all the knowledge of the age. In the next
century the old culture-lands had to turn for some little light and
teaching to that remote and lately barbarous land."</p></blockquote>

<p>When we remember that the darkness of the Middle Ages
had already set in over the struggles, agony, and confusion of
feudal Europe, and that all knowledge of Greek may be said
to have died out upon the Continent&mdash;"had elsewhere absolutely
vanished," says M. Darmesteter&mdash;when we remember that
even such a man as Gregory the Great was completely ignorant
of it, it will appear extraordinary to find it taught in Ireland
alone, out of all the countries of Western Europe.<a name="FNanchor_3_339" id="FNanchor_3_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_339" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Yet this
is capable of complete and manifold proof. Columbanus for
instance, shows in his letter to Pope Boniface that he knows
something of both Greek and Hebrew.<a name="FNanchor_4_340" id="FNanchor_4_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_340" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Aileran, who died of
the plague in 664, gives evidence of the same in his book on
our Lord's genealogy. Cummian's letter to the Abbot of
Iona has been referred to before, and, as Professor G. Stokes puts
it, "proves the fact to demonstration that in the first half of
the seventh century there was a wide range of Greek learning,
not ecclesiastical merely, but chronological, astronomical, and
philosophical, away at Durrow in the very centre of the Bog
of Allen." Augustine, an un-identified Irish monk of the
second half of the seventh century, gives many proofs of Greek
and Oriental learning and quotes the Chronicles of Eusebius.
The later Sedulius, the versatile abbot of Kildare, about the
year 820 "makes parade of his Greek knowledge," to quote a
French writer in the "Revue Celtique," "employs Greek words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
without necessity, and translates into Greek a part of the
definition of the pronoun."<a name="FNanchor_5_341" id="FNanchor_5_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_341" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> St. Caimins's Psalter, seen by
Bishop Ussher with the Hebrew text collated, convinced Dr.
Reeves that Hebrew as well as Greek was studied in Ireland
about the year 600. Nor did this Greek learning tend to die
out. In the middle of the ninth century John Scotus
Erigena, summoned from Ireland to France by Charles the
Bald, was the only person to be found able to translate the
Greek works of the pseudo-Dionysius,<a name="FNanchor_6_342" id="FNanchor_6_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_342" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> thanks to the training
he had received in his Irish school. The Book of Armagh
contains the Lord's Prayer written in Greek letters, and there
is a Greek MS. of the Psalter, written in Sedulius' own hand,
now preserved in Paris. Many more Greek texts, at least a
dozen, written by Irish monks, are preserved elsewhere in
Europe. "These eighth and ninth century Greek MSS.,"
remarks Professor Stokes, "covered with Irish glosses and Irish
poems and Irish notes, have engaged the attention of palæographers
and students of the Greek texts of the New Testament
during the last two centuries." They are indeed a proof
that&mdash;as Dr. Reeves puts it&mdash;the Irish School "was unquestionably
the most advanced of its day in sacred literature."</p>

<p>This remarkable knowledge of Greek was evidently derived
from an early and direct commerce with Gaul, where Greek
had been spoken for four or five centuries, first alongside of
Celtic, and in later times of Latin also.<a name="FNanchor_7_343" id="FNanchor_7_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_343" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
of Hebrew may have been derived from the Egyptian monks
who passed over from Gaul into Ireland. Egypt and the East
were more or less in close communication with Gaul in the
fifth century, and the Irish Litany, ascribed to Angus the
Culdee, commemorates seven Egyptian monks amongst many
other Gauls, Germans, and Italians who resided in Ireland.
The close and constant intercommunication between Greek-speaking
Gaul and Ireland accounts for the planting and cultivation
of the Greek language in the Irish schools, and once
planted there it continued to flourish more or less for some
centuries. There is ample evidence to prove the connection
between Gaul and Ireland from the fifth to the ninth century.
We find Gaulish merchants in the middle of Ireland at
Clonmacnois, who had no doubt sailed up the Shannon in the
way of commerce, selling wine to Ciaran in the sixth century.
We find Columbanus, a little later on, inquiring at Nantes for
a vessel engaged in the Irish trade&mdash;<i>quæ vexerat commercium cum
Hibernia</i>. In Adamnan's Life of Columcille we find
mention of Gaulish sailors arriving at Cantire. Adamnan's
own treatise on Holy Places was written from the verbal
account of a Gaul. In the Old Irish poem on the Fair
of Carman in Wexford&mdash;a pagan institution which lived on
in Christian times&mdash;we find mention of the</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Great market of the foreign Greeks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where gold and noble clothes were wont to be;"<a name="FNanchor_8_344" id="FNanchor_8_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_344" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>the foreign Greeks being no doubt the Greek-speaking
Gaulish merchants. Alcuin sends his gifts of money and oil
and his letters direct from Charlemagne's court to his friends
in Clonmacnois, probably by a vessel engaged in the direct
Irish trade, for, as he himself tells us, the sea-route between
England and France was then closed. If more proof of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
close communication between Ireland and Gaul were wanted,
the fact that Dagobert II., king of France in the seventh
century, was educated at Slane,<a name="FNanchor_9_345" id="FNanchor_9_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_345" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in Ireland, and also that
certain Merovingian and French coins have been found
here, should be sufficient.</p>

<p>The fame of these early Irish schools attracted students in
the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries from all quarters to
Ireland, which had now become a veritable land of schools
and scholars. The Venerable Bede tells us of the crowds
of Anglo-Saxons who flocked over into Ireland during the
plague, about the year 664, and says that they were all warmly
welcomed by the Irish, who took care that they should be
provided with food every day, without payment on their part;
that they should have books to read, and that they should
receive gratuitous instruction from Irish masters.<a name="FNanchor_10_346" id="FNanchor_10_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_346" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Books
must have already multiplied considerably when the swarms
of Anglo-Saxons could thus be supplied with them gratis.
This noble tradition of free education to strangers lasted down
to the establishment of the so-called "National" schools in
Ireland, for down to that time "poor scholars" were freely
supported by the people and helped in their studies. The number
of scribes whose deaths have been considered worth
recording by the annalists is very great, and books consequently
must have been very numerous. This plentifulness of books
probably added to the renown of the Irish schools. An English
prince as well as a French one was educated by them in the
seventh century; this was Aldfrid, king of Northumbria, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
was trained in all the learning of Erin, and who always aided
and abetted the Irish in England, in opposition to Wilfrid, who
opposed them. That the king got a good education in Ireland
may be conjectured from the fact that Aldhelm, abbot of
Malmesbury, dedicated to him a poetic epistle on Latin
metric and prosody, in which, says Dr. Healy, "he congratulates
the king on his good fortune in having been educated
in Ireland." Aldhelm's own master was also an Irishman,
Mael-dubh, and his abbacy of Malmesbury is only a corruption
of this Irishman's name Maeldubh's-bury.<a name="FNanchor_11_347" id="FNanchor_11_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_347" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In another place
Aldhelm tells us that while the great English school at Canterbury
was by no means overcrowded, the English swarmed to
the Irish schools like bees. Aldfrid himself, when leaving
Ireland, composed a poem of sixty lines in the Irish language
and metre, which he must have learned from the bards, in
which he compliments each of the provinces severally, as
though he meant to thank the whole nation for their hospitality.<a name="FNanchor_12_348" id="FNanchor_12_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_348" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I found in Inisfail the fair</span><br />

</p>

<p>St. Willibrord, a Saxon noble educated in Ireland about
the same time with King Aldfrid, went out thence and
ultimately became Archbishop of Utrecht. Another noted
scholar of the same period was Agilbert, a Frank by birth,
who spent a long time in Ireland for the purpose of study and
afterwards became Bishop of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_13_349" id="FNanchor_13_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_349" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> We have seen how the
Office of St. Cathaldus states that the school of Lismore was
visited by Gauls, Angles, Scotti, Teutons, and scholars from
other neighbouring nations. The same was more or less the
case with Clonmacnois, Bangor, and some others of the most
noted of the Irish schools.</p>

<p>It was not in Greek attainments, nor in ecclesiastical studies,
nor in Latin verses alone, that the Irish excelled; they also
produced astronomers like Dungal and geographers like
Dicuil. Dungal's attainments we have glanced at, but
Dicuil's book&mdash;<i>de mensura orbis terrarum</i>&mdash;written about the
year 825, is more interesting, although nothing is known about
the author's own life, nor do we know even the particular
Irish school to which he belonged.<a name="FNanchor_14_350" id="FNanchor_14_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_350" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> His book was published
by a Frenchman because he found Dicuil's descriptions of the
measurements of the Pyramids a thousand years ago tallied
with his own.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Antioch," writes Professor G. Stokes, "about A.D. 600, was the
centre of Greek culture and Greek erudition, and the chronicle of
Malalas, as embodied in Niebuhr's series of Byzantine historians,
is a mine of information on many questions; but compare it with
the Irish work of Dicuil and its mistakes are laughable."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>A great deal of his work is founded of course upon Pliny,
Solinus, and Priscian, but he shows a highly-developed critical
sense in comparing and collating various MSS. which he had
inspected to ensure accuracy. What he tells us at first-hand,
however, is by far the most interesting. In speaking of the
Nile he says that:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although we never read in any book that any branch of the Nile
flows into the Red Sea, yet Brother Fidelis told in my presence to
my master Suibhne [Sweeny]&mdash;to whom under God I owe whatever
knowledge I possess&mdash;that certain clerics and laymen from Ireland
who went to Jerusalem on pilgrimage sailed up the Nile a long way."</p></blockquote>

<p>They sailed thence by a canal into the Red Sea, and this statement
proves the accuracy of Dicuil, for this canal really existed
and continued in use until 767, when it was closed to hinder
the people of Mecca and Medina getting supplies from Egypt.
The account of the Pyramids is particularly interesting.
"The aforesaid Brother Fidelis measured one of them and
found that the square face was 400 feet in length." The
same brother wished to examine the exact point where Moses
had entered the Red Sea in order to try if he could find any
traces of the chariots of Pharaoh or the wheel tracks, but the
sailors were in a hurry and would not allow him to go on this
excursion. The breadth of the sea appeared to him at this
point to be about six miles. Dicuil describes Iceland long
before it was discovered by the Danes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is now thirty years," said he, writing in 825, "since I was told
by some Irish ecclesiastics, who had dwelt in that island from the
1st of February to the 1st of August, that the sun scarcely sets
there in summer, but always leaves, even at midnight, light enough
to do one's ordinary business&mdash;<i>vel pediculos de camisia abstrahere</i>"!</p></blockquote>

<p>Those writers are greatly mistaken, he says, who describe the
Icelandic sea as always frozen, and who say that there is day
there from spring to autumn and from autumn to spring, for
the Irish monks sailed thither through the open sea in a month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
of great natural cold, and yet found alternate day and night,
except about the period of the summer solstice. He also
describes the Faroe Isles:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A certain trustworthy monk told me that he reached one of them
by sailing for two summer days and one night in a vessel with two
benches of rowers.... In these islands for almost a hundred
years there dwelt hermits who sailed there from our own Ireland
[nostra Scottia], but now they are once more deserted as they were
at the beginning, on account of the ravages of the Norman pirates."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is proof positive that the Irish discovered and inhabited
Iceland and the Faroe Islands half a century or a century
before the Northmen. Dicuil was distinguished as a grammarian,
metrician, and astronomer,<a name="FNanchor_15_351" id="FNanchor_15_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_351" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but his geographical treatise,
written in his old age, is the most interesting and valuable of
his achievements.</p>

<p>Fergil, or Virgilius, as he is usually called, was another great
Irish geometer, who eventually became Archbishop of Salzburg
and died in 785. He taught the sphericity of the earth and
the doctrine of the Antipodes, a truth which seems also to have
been familiar to Dicuil. St. Boniface, afterwards Archbishop
of Mentz, evidently distorting his doctrine, accused him to the
Pope of heresy in teaching that there was another world and
other men under the earth, and another sun and moon.
"Concerning this charge of false doctrine, if it shall be
established," said the Pope, "that Virgil taught this perverse
and wicked doctrine against God and his own soul,
do you then convoke a council, degrade him from the priesthood,
and drive him from the Church." Virgil, however,
seems to have satisfactorily explained his position, for nothing
was done against him.</p>

<p>These instances help to throw some light upon a most
difficult subject&mdash;the training given in the early Irish Christian
schools, and the cause of their undoubted popularity for three
centuries and more amongst the scholars of Western Europe.</p>

Dr. Sigerson in "Bards of the Gael and Gaul," p. 407, prints as Jubainville
also does, the whole of this noted poem, and points out that it is shot
through and through with Irish assonance. "Not less important than its
assonance," writes Dr. Sigerson, "is the fact that it introduces into Latin
verse the use of returning words, or burthens with variations, which
supply the vital germs of the rondeau and the ballad." I am not myself
convinced of what Dr. Sigerson considers marks of <i>intentional</i> assonance
in almost <i>every</i> line.

His chief remaining works are a Monastic Rule in ten chapters; a book
on the daily penances of the monks; seventeen sermons; a book on the
measure of penances; a treatise on the eight principal vices; five
epistles written to Gregory the Great and others; and a good many Latin
verses. His life is written by the Abbot Jonas, a contemporary of
his own.</p></div>

<h4>CONFLICTS WITH THE CIVIL POWER</h4>


<p>The extraordinary and abnormal receptivity of the Irish of
the fifth century, and the still more wonderful and unprecedented
activity of their descendants in the sixth and following
ones had almost bid fair to turn the nation into a land of
apostles. This outburst of religious zeal, glorious and enduring
as it was, carried with it, like all sudden and powerful
movements, an element of danger. It was unfortunately
destined in its headlong course to overflow its legitimate
barriers and to come into rude contact with the civil power
which had been established upon lines more ancient and not
wholly sympathetic.</p>

<p>A striking passage in one of Renan's books dwells upon the
obvious religious inferiority of the Greeks and Romans to the
Jews, while it notes at the same time their immense political
and intellectual superiority over the Semitic nation. The
inferiority of the Jew in matters political and intellectual the
French writer seems inclined to attribute to his abnormally
developed religious sense, which, absorbed in itself, took all too
little heed of the civic side of life and of the necessities of the
state. Nor can it, I think, be denied that primitive Christianity
in some cases took over from the Hebrews a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
amount of this spirit of self-absorption and of disregard for the
civil side of life and social polity. "Quand on prend les choses
humaines par ce côté," remarks Renan, "on fonde de grands
prosélytismes universels, on a des apôtres courant le monde
d'un bout à l'autre, et le convertissant; mais on ne fonde pas
des institutions politiques, une indépendance nationale, une
dynastie, un code, un peuple."</p>

<p>We have already seen how the exaggerated pretensions of
St. Columcille had come almost at once into opposition with
the established law of the land, the law which enjoined death
as the penalty for homicide at Tara, and how the priest
unjustifiably took upon himself to override the civil magistrate
in the person of the king.</p>

<p>Of precisely such a nature&mdash;only with far worse and far
more enduring consequences&mdash;was the cursing of Tara by St.
Ruadhan of Lothra. The great palace where, according to
general belief, a hundred and thirty-six pagan and six Christian
kings had ruled uninterruptedly, the most august spot in all
Ireland, where a "truce of God" had always reigned during
the great triennial assemblies, was now to be given up and
deserted at the curse of a tonsured monk. The great
Assembly or Féis of Tara, which accustomed the people to
the idea of a centre of government and a ruling power,
could no more be convened, and a thousand associations and
memories which hallowed the office of the High-king were
snapped in a moment. It was a blow from which the
monarchy of Ireland never recovered, a blow which, by
putting an end to the great triennial or septennial conventions
of the whole Irish race, weakened the prestige of the
central ruler, increased the power of the provincial chieftains,
segregated the clans of Ireland from one another, and opened
a new road for faction and dissension throughout the entire
island.</p>

<p>There is a considerable amount of mystery attached to this
whole transaction, and all the great Irish annalists, the "Four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Masters," the "Chronicon Scotorum," the Annals of Ulster,
Tighearnach, and Keating, are absolutely silent upon the
matter.<a name="FNanchor_1_352" id="FNanchor_1_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_352" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The "Four Masters," indeed, under the year 554
record "the last Féis of Tara,"<a name="FNanchor_2_353" id="FNanchor_2_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_353" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as does Tighearnach also;
but why it was the last, or why Tara was deserted, they do
not say. Yet so great a national event was infinitely too
important to have been passed over in silence except for some
special reason, and I cannot help thinking that it was not
alluded to because the annalists did not care to recall it. The
authorities for the cursing of Tara are the lost "Annals of
Clonmacnois," which were translated into English by Connell
Mac Geoghegan in 1627, and which give a very long and
full account of the matter;<a name="FNanchor_3_354" id="FNanchor_3_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_354" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> an Irish MS. in Trinity College,
Dublin;<a name="FNanchor_4_355" id="FNanchor_4_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_355" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the Life of St. Ruadhan himself, in the fourteenth
century (?) codex the Book of Kilkenny, now in Marsh's
Library; and his life as published by the Bollandists; the
ancient scholiast on Fiach's hymn on the Life of St.
Patrick; a fifteenth century vellum in the British Museum,
which professes to copy from the lost Book of Sligo; the
Book of Right,<a name="FNanchor_5_356" id="FNanchor_5_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_356" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and the Book of Lismore, which last,
though it turns the story into an <i>úrsgeul</i>, or romance, yet
agrees closely in essentials with the lost "Annals of Clonmacnois."
The story, as told in this manuscript, is worth
producing as a specimen of how the Irish loved to turn every
great historical event into an <i>úrsgeul</i>, seasoned with a good
spice of the marvellous, and dressed up dramatically. How
much of such pseudo-histories is true, how much invented for
the occasion, and how much may be stock-in-trade of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
story-teller, is never easily determined. The story runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>King Diarmuid's steward and spear-bearer had been ill and
wasting away for a year. On his recovery he goes to the
King, and asks him whether "the order of his discipline and
peace" had been observed during the time of his illness. The
King answered that he had noticed no breach or diminution
of it. The spear-bearer said he would make sure of the
King's peace by travelling round Ireland with his spear held
transversely, and he would see whether the door of every liss
and fortress would be opened wide enough to let the spear
pass&mdash;such on the approach of the King's spear seems to have
been the law&mdash;and "so shall the regimen and peace of
Ireland," said he "be ascertained."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From Tara, therefore, goes forth the spear-bearer,<a name="FNanchor_6_357" id="FNanchor_6_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_357" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and with
him the King of Ireland's herald, to proclaim Ireland's peace, and
he arrived in the province of Connacht, and made his way to the
mansion of Aedh [Æ] Guairè of Kinelfechin. And he at that time
had round his rath a stockade of red oak, and had a new house too,
that was but just built [no doubt inside the rath] with a view to his
marriage feast. Now, a week before the spear-bearer's arrival the
other had heard that he was on his way to him, and had given orders
to make an opening before him in the palisade [but not in the
dwelling].</p>

<p>"The spear-bearer came accordingly, and Aedh Guairè bade him
welcome. The spear-bearer said that the house must be hewn
[open to the right width] before him.</p>

<p>"'Give thine own orders as to how it may please thee to have it
hewn,' said Aedh Guairè, but, even as he spake it, he gave a stroke
of his sword to the spear-bearer, so that he took his head from off
him.</p>

<p>"Now at this time the discipline of Ireland was such that whosoever
killed a man void of offence, neither cattle nor other valuable
consideration might be taken in lieu of the slain, but the slayer
must be killed, unless it were that the King should order or permit
the acceptance of a cattle-price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"When King Diarmuid heard of the killing he sent his young men
and his executive to waste and to spoil Aedh Guairè. And he flees to
Bishop Senan, for one mother they had both, and Senan the bishop
goes with him to Ruadhan of Lothra, for it was two sisters of
Lothra that nursed Bishop Senan, Cael and Ruadhnait were their
names. But Aedh Guairè found no protection with Ruadhan, but
was banished away into Britain for a year, and Diarmuid's people
came to seek for him in Britain, so he was again sent back to
Ruadhan. And Diarmuid himself comes to Ruadhan to look for
him, but he had been put into a hole in the ground by Ruadhan,
which is to-day called 'Ruadhan's Hole.' Diarmuid sent his man
to look in Ruadhan's kitchen whether Aedh Guiarè were there. But
on the man's going into the kitchen his eyes were at once struck
blind. When Diarmuid saw this, he went into the kitchen himself,
but he did not find Aedh Guiarè there. And he asked Ruadhan
where he was, for he was sure he would tell him no lie.</p>

<p>"'I know not where he is,' said Ruadhan, 'if he be not under
yon thatch.'</p>

<p>"After that Diarmuid departs to his house, but he remembered
the cleric's word and returns to the recluse's cell, and he sees the
candle being brought to the spot where Aedh Guairè was. And he
sends a confidential servant to bring him forth&mdash;Donnán Donn was
his name&mdash;and he dug down in the hiding place, but the arm he
stretched out to take Aedh withered to the shoulder. And he
makes obeisance to Ruadhan after that, and the two servants
remained with Ruadhan after that in Poll Ruadhain. After this
Diarmuid [himself] carries off Aedh Guairè to Tara."</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon this, we are told, Ruadhan made his way to Brendan
of Birr, and thence to the so-called twelve apostles of Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_7_358" id="FNanchor_7_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_358" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and they all followed the King and came to Tara, and they
fast upon the King that night, and he, "relying on his kingly
quality and on the justice of his cause, fasts upon them."<a name="FNanchor_8_359" id="FNanchor_8_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_359" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In such fashion, and to the end of a year they continued before
Tara under Ruadhan's tent exposed to weather and to wet, and they
were every other night without food, Diarmuid and the clergy, fasting
on each other."</p></blockquote>

<p>After this the story goes on that Brendan the Navigator had
in the meantime landed from his foreign expeditions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
hearing that the other saints of Ireland were fasting before
Tara, he also proceeds thither. But King Diarmuid, learning
of his coming, was terrified, and consented to give up Aedh
Guairè for "fifty horses, blue-eyed with golden bridles."
Brendan the Voyager, fresh from his triumphs on the ocean,
summons fifty seals and makes them look like horses, and
guaranteeing them for a year and a quarter, hands them over
to the King and receives Aedh Guairè. But when the time
guaranteed was out, they became seals again, and brought their
riders with them into the sea. And Diarmuid was very wroth
at the deception, "and shut the seven lisses of Tara to the end
that the clergy should not enter into Tara, lest they should
leave behind malevolence and evil bequests."</p>

<p>It appears that the clerics still continued fasting upon the
King, and he fasting upon them,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And people were assigned [by the King] to wait upon them and
to keep watch and ward over them until the clergy should have accomplished
the act of eating and consuming food in their presence. But
on this night Brendan gave them this advice&mdash;their cowls to be about
their heads and they to let their meat and ale pass by their mouths
into their bosoms and down to the ground, and this they did. Word
was brought to the King that the clergy were consuming meat and
ale, so Diarmuid ate meat that night, but the clerics on the other
hand fasted on him through stratagem.</p>

<p>"Now Diarmuid's wife&mdash;Mughain was his wife&mdash;saw a dream, which
dream was this, that upon the green of Tara was a vast and wide-foliaged
tree, and eleven slaves hewing at it, but every chip which
they knocked from it would return into its place again and adhere to
it [as before], till at last there came one man that dealt the tree but a
stroke, and with that single cut laid it low, as the poet spoke the lay&mdash;</p>

<p>"As for Diarmuid, son of Cerbhall [the King], after that dream he
arose early, so that he heard the clergy chant their psalms, and he
entered into the house in which they were.</p>

<p>"'Alas!' he said, 'for the iniquitous contest which ye have waged
against me, seeing that it is Ireland's good that I pursue, and to preserve
her discipline and royal right, but 'tis Ireland's unpeace and
murderousness which ye endeavour after. For God Himself it is
who on such or such a one confers the orders of prince, of righteous
ruler, and of equitable judgment, to the end that he may maintain
his truthfulness, his princely quality, and his governance. Now that
to which a king is bound is to have mercy coupled with stringency
of law, and peace maintained in the sub-districts, and hostages in
fetters; to succour the wretched, but to overwhelm enemies, and to
banish falsehood, for unless on this hither side one do the King of
Heaven's will, no excuse is accepted by him on the other. And thou,
Ruadhan,' said Diarmuid, 'through thee it is that injury and rending
of my mercy and of mine integrity to Godward is come about, and
I pray God that thy diocese be the first in Ireland that shall be
renounced, and thy Church lands the first that shall be impugned.'</p>

<p>"But Ruadhan said, 'Rather may thy dynasty come to nought, and
none that is son or grandson to thee establish himself in Tara for
ever!'</p>

<p>"Diarmuid said, 'Be thy Church desolate continually.'</p>

<p>"Ruadhan said, 'Desolate be Tara for ever and for ever.'</p>

<p>"Diarmuid said, 'May a limb of thy limbs be wanting to thee, and
come not with thee under ground, and mayest thou lack an eye!</p>

<p>"'Have thou before death an evil countenance in sight of all; may
thine enemies prevail over thee mightily, and the thigh that thou
liftedst not before me to stand up, be the same mangled into pieces.'</p>

<p>"Said Diarmuid, 'The thing [<i>i.e.</i>, the man] about which is our
dispute, take him with you, but in thy church, Ruadhan, may the
alarm cry sound at nones always, and even though all Ireland be
at peace be thy church's precinct a scene of war continuously.'</p>

<p>"And from that time to this the same is fulfilled."<a name="FNanchor_9_360" id="FNanchor_9_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_360" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There follows a poem of 88 lines uttered by the King.</p>

<p>The same story in all its essential details is told in the MS.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Egerton 1782, a vellum of the fifteenth century, which professes
to follow the lost Book of Sligo. It is quite as unbiassed
and outspoken about the result of the clerics' action as the
Book of Lismore. It makes Diarmuid address the clerics thus&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Evil is that which ye have worked O clerics, my kingdom's ruination.
For in the latter times Ireland shall not be better off than she
is at this present. But, however it fall out,' said he, 'may bad
chiefs, their heirs-apparent, and their men of war, quarter themselves
in your churches, and may it be their [<i>read</i> your?] own selves
that in your houses shall pull off such peoples' brogues for them, ye
being the while powerless to rid yourselves of them.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>This codex sympathises so strongly with the king that it
states that one of Ruadhan's eyes burst in his head when the king
cursed him. Beg mac De, the celebrated Christian prophet, is
made to prophecy thus, when the king asks him in what fashion
his kingdom should be after his death,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'An evil world,' said the prophet, 'is now at hand, in which men
shall be in bondage, woman free; mast wanting; woods smooth;
blossom bad; winds many; wet summer; green corn; much cattle;
scant milk; dependants burdensome in every country, hogs lean,
chiefs wicked; bad faith; <i>chronic killing; a world withered, raths in
number</i>.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>King Diarmuid died in 558, according to the "Four
Masters;" it is certain he never retreated a foot from Tara,
but it was probably his next successor who, intimidated at the
clerics' curse and the ringing of their bells&mdash;for they circled
Tara ringing their bells against it&mdash;deserted the royal hill
for ever.<a name="FNanchor_10_361" id="FNanchor_10_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_361" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The palace of Cletty, not far from Tara, was also cursed by
St. Cairneach at the request of the queen of the celebrated
Muircheartach Mór mac Earca, and deserted in consequence.<a name="FNanchor_11_362" id="FNanchor_11_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_362" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>Another, but probably more justifiable, instance of the clergy
fasting upon a lay ruler and cursing him, was that of the
notorious Raghallach (Reilly), king of Connacht, who made
his queen jealous by his infidelity, and committed other crimes.
The story is thus recorded by Keating&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The scandal of that evil deed soon spread throughout all the land
and the saints of Ireland were sorrowful by reason thereof. St.
Fechin of Fobar [Fore is West Meath] came in person to Raghallach
to reprehend him, and many saints came in his company to aid him
in inducing the prince to discontinue his criminal amour. But
Raghallach despised their exhortations. Thereupon they fasted
against him, and as there were many other evil-minded persons
besides him in the land, they made an especial prayer to God that for
the sake of an example he should not live out the month of May,
then next to come on, and that he should fall by the hands of villains,
by vile instruments, and in a filthy place; and all these things happened
to him,"</p></blockquote>

<p>as Keating goes on to relate, for he was killed by turf-cutters.</p>

<p>Sometimes the saints are found on opposite sides, as at
the Battle of Cooldrevna where Columcille prayed against
the High-king's arms, and Finian prayed for them; or as in
the well-known case of the expulsion of poor old St.
Mochuda<a name="FNanchor_12_363" id="FNanchor_12_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_363" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and his monks in 631 from the monastery at
Rathain, where his piety and success had aroused the jealousy
of the clerics of the Ui Neill, who ejected him by force, despite
his malediction. It was then he returned to his own province
and founded Lismore, which soon became famous.<a name="FNanchor_13_364" id="FNanchor_13_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_364" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Led away by our admiration of the magnificent outburst of
learning and the innumerable examples of undoubted devotion
displayed by Irishmen from the sixth to the ninth century, we
are very liable to overlook the actual state of society, and to
read into a still primitive social constitution the thoughts and
ideas of later ages, forgetting the real spirit of those early times.
We must remember that St. Patrick had made no change in
the social constitution of the people, and that the new religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
in no way affected their external institutions, and as a natural
consequence even saints and clerics took the side of their own
kings and people, and fought in battle with as much gusto as
any of the clansmen. Women fought side by side with men,
and were only exempted from military service in 590, through
the influence of Columcille at the synod of Druimceat&mdash;of
which synod more hereafter, and Adamnan had to get the law
renewed over a hundred years later, for it had become inoperative.
The monks were of course as liable as any other of
the tribesmen to perform military duty to their lords, and were
only exempted<a name="FNanchor_14_365" id="FNanchor_14_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_365" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> from it in the year 804. The clergy fought
with Cormac mac Culenain as late as 908 at the battle where
he fell, and a great number of them were killed.<a name="FNanchor_15_366" id="FNanchor_15_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_366" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The
clergy often quarrelled among themselves also. In 673 the
monks of Clonmacnois and Durrow fought one another, and
the men of Clonmacnois slew two hundred of their opponents.
In 816 four hundred men were slain in a fight between rival
monasteries. The clan system, in fact, applied down to the
eighth or ninth century almost as much to the clergy as to the
laity, and with the abandonment of Tara and the weakening
of the High-kingship, the only power which bid fair to override
feud and faction was got rid of, and every man drank for
himself the intoxicating draught of irresponsibility, and each
princeling became a Cæsar in his own community.</p>

<p>The saints with their long-accredited exercises of semi-miraculous
powers, formed an admirable ingredient wherewith
to spice a historic romance, such as the soul of the Irish story-tellers
loved, and they were not slow to avail themselves of it.</p>

<p>A passage in the celebrated history of the Boru tribute,
preserved in the twelfth-century Book of Leinster, turns both
Columcille and his biographer Adamnan to account in this
way, by introducing dialogues between them and their contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
kings of Ireland, which are worth giving here, as
they preserve some primitive traits, but more especially as an
example of how the later medievalists conceived their own
early saints. Aedh [Ae], the High-king of Ireland, had asked
Columcille how many kings of all whom he himself had come
in contact with, or had cognisance of, would win, or had won,
to heaven; and Columcille answered:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Certainly I know of only three, Daimín King of Oriel, and Ailill
King of Connacht, and Feradach of Corkalee, King of Ossory.'</p>

<p>"'And what good did they do,' said Aedh, 'beyond all other
kings?'</p>

<p>"'That's easy told,' said Columcille, 'as for Daimín no cleric ever
departed from him having met with a refusal, and he never reviled
a cleric, nor spoiled church nor sanctuary, and greatly did he bestow
upon the Lord. Afterwards he went to heaven, on account of his mild
dealing with the Lord's people; and the clerics still chant his litany.</p>

<p>"'As for Ailill, moreover, this is how he found the Lord's clemency;
he fought the battle of Cúl Conairé with the Clan Fiacrach, and they
defeated him in that battle, and he said to his charioteer, "Look
behind for us, and see whether the slaying is great, and are the
slayers near us?"</p>

<p>"'The charioteer looked behind him, and 'twas what he said:</p>

<p>"'"The slaying with which your people are slain," said he, "is
unendurable."</p>

<p>"'"It is not their own guilt that falls on them, but the guilt of my
pride and my untruthfulness," said he; "and turn the chariot for us
against [the enemy]," said he, "for if I be slain amidst them (?) it
will be the saving of a multitude.'</p>

<p>"'Thereupon the chariot was turned round against the enemy, and
thereafter did Ailill earnestly repent, and fell by his enemies. So
that man got the Lord's clemency,' said Columcille.</p>

<p>"'As for Feradach,<a name="FNanchor_16_367" id="FNanchor_16_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_367" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the King of Ossory, moreover, he was a
covetous man without a conscience, and if he were to hear that a
man in his territory had only one scruple of gold or silver, he would
take it to himself by force, and put it in the covers of goblets
and crannogues and swords and chessmen. Thereafter there came
upon him an unendurable sickness. They collect round him all
his treasures, so that he had them in his bed. His enemies came,
the Clan Connla, after that, to seize the house on him. His sons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
too, came to him to carry away the jewels with them [to save them
for him].</p>

<p>"'"Do not take them away, my sons," said he, "for I harried many
for those treasures, and I desire to harry myself on this side the
tomb for them, and that my enemies may bring them away of my
good will, so that the Deity may not harry me on the other side."</p>

<p>"'After that his sons departed from him, and he himself made
earnest repentance, and died at the hands of his enemies, and gains
the clemency of the Lord.'</p>

<p>"'Now as for me myself,' said Aedh, 'shall I gain the Lord's
clemency?'</p>

<p>"'Thou shalt not gain it on any account,' said Columcille.</p>

<p>"'Well, then, cleric,' said he, 'procure for me from the Deity that
the Leinster men [at least] may not overthrow me.'</p>

<p>"'Well, now, that is difficult for me,' said Columcille, 'for my
mother was one of them, and the Leinstermen came to me to
Durrow,<a name="FNanchor_17_368" id="FNanchor_17_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_368" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and made as though they would fast upon me, till I should
grant them a sister's son's request, and what they asked of me was
that no outside king should ever overthrow them; and I promised
them that too, but here is my cowl for thee, and thou shalt not be
slain while it is about thee.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Less clement is Adamnan depicted in his interview, over a
century later, with King Finnachta, who had just been persuaded
by St. Molling<a name="FNanchor_18_369" id="FNanchor_18_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_369" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to remit the Boru tribute (then leviable
off Leinster), until <i>luan</i>, by which the King unwarily understood
Monday, but the more acute saint Doomsday, the word
having both significations. Adamnan saw through the deception
in a moment, and hastened to interrupt the plans of his
brother saint.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He sought therefore," says the Book of Leinster, "the place
where [king] Finnachta was, and sent a clerk of his familia to summon
him to a conference. Finnachta, at the instant, busied himself with
a game of chess, and the cleric said, 'Come, speak with Adamnan.'</p>

<p>"'I will not,' he answered, 'until this game be ended.'</p>

<p>"The ecclesiastic returned to Adamnan and retailed him this
answer. Then the saint said, 'Go and tell him that in the interval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
I shall chant fifty psalms, in which fifty is a single psalm that will
deprive his children and grandchildren, and even any namesake of
his, for ever of the kingdom.'<a name="FNanchor_19_370" id="FNanchor_19_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_370" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>"Again the clerk accosted Finnachta and told him this, but until
his game was played the King never noticed him at all.</p>

<p>"'Come, speak with Adamnan,' repeated the clerk, 'and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'I will not,' answered Finnachta, 'till this [fresh] game, too,
shall be finished,' all which the cleric rendered to Adamnan, who
said:</p>

<p>"'A second time begone to him, tell him that I will sing other
fifty psalms, in which fifty is one that will confer on him shortness
of life.'</p>

<p>"This, too, the clerk, when he was come back, proclaimed to
Finnachta, but till the game was done, he never even perceived the
messenger, who for the third time reiterated his speech.</p>

<p>"'Till this new game be played out I will not go,' said the King,
and the cleric carried it to Adamnan.</p>

<p>"'Go to him,' the holy man said, 'tell him that in the meantime I
will sing fifty psalms, and among them is one that will deprive him
of attaining the Lord's peace.'</p>

<p>"This the clerk imparted to Finnachta, who, when he heard it,
with speed and energy put from him the chess-board, and hastened
to where Adamnan was.</p>

<p>"'Finnachta,' quoth the saint, 'what is thy reason for coming
now, whereas at the first summons thou earnest not?'</p>

<p>"'Soon said,' replied Finnachta. 'As for that which first thou
didst threaten against me; that of my children, or even of my
namesakes, not an individual ever should rule Ireland&mdash;I took it
easily. The other matter which thou heldest out to me&mdash;shortness
of life&mdash;that I esteemed but lightly, for Molling had promised me
heaven. But the third thing which thou threatenedst me&mdash;to deprive
me of the Lord's peace&mdash;that I endured not to hear without coming
in obedience to thy voice.'</p>

<p>"Now the motive for which God wrought this was: that the gift
which Molling had promised to the King for remission of the tribute
He suffered not Adamnan to dock him of."</p></blockquote>

<p>It would be easy to multiply such scenes from the writings
of the ancient Irish. That they are not altogether eleventh
or twelfth-century inventions, but either the embodiment of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
vivid tradition, or else, in some cases, the working-up of earlier
documents, now lost, is, I think, certain, but we possess no
criterion whereby we may winnow out the grains of truth
from the chaff of myth, invention, or perhaps in some cases
(where tribal honour is at stake) deliberate falsehood. The
only thing we can say with perfect certainty is that this is the
way in which the contemporaries of St. Lawrence O'Toole
pictured for themselves the contemporaries of St. Columcille
and St. Adamnan.</p>

<h4>THE BARDIC SCHOOLS</h4>


<p>We must now, leaving verifiable history behind us, attempt a
cautious step backwards from the known into the doubtful,
and see what in the way of literature <i>is said</i> to have been
produced by the pagans. We know that side by side with
the colleges of the clergy there flourished, perhaps in a more
informal way, the purely Irish schools of the Brehons and the
Bards. Unhappily however, while, thanks to the great
number of the Lives of the Saints,<a name="FNanchor_1_371" id="FNanchor_1_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_371" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> we know much about
the Christian colleges, there is very little to be discovered about
the bardic institutions. These were almost certainly a continuation
of the schools of the druids, and represented something
far more antique than even the very earliest schools of
the Christians, but unlike them they were not centred in a
fixed locality nor in a cluster of houses, but seem to have been
peripatetic. The bardic scholars grouped themselves not
round a locality but round a personality, and wherever it
pleased their master to wander&mdash;and that was pretty much all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
round Ireland&mdash;there they followed, and the people seem to
have willingly supported them.</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion as to the forms into
which what must have been originally the druidic school
disintegrated itself in the fifth and succeeding centuries, but
from it we can see emerging the poet, the Brehon, and the
historian, not all at once, but gradually. In the earliest period
the functions of all three were often, if not always, united in
one single person, and all poets were <i>ipso facto</i> judges as well.
We have a distinct account of the great occasion upon which
the poet lost his privilege of acting as a judge merely because
he was a poet. It appears that from the very earliest date the
learned classes, especially the "f&#301;lès," had evolved a dialect of
their own, which was perfectly dark and obscure to every one
except themselves. This was the Béarla Féni, in which so
much of the Brehon law and many poems are written, and
which continued to be used, to some extent, by poets down to
the very beginning of the eighteenth century. Owing to
their predilection for this dialect, the first blow, according to
Irish accounts, was struck at their judicial supremacy by the
hands of laymen, during the reign of Conor mac Nessa, some
time before the birth of Christ. This was the occasion when
the sages Fercertné and Neidé contended for the office of
arch-ollav of Erin, with its beautiful robe of feathers, the
Tugen.<a name="FNanchor_2_372" id="FNanchor_2_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_372" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Their discourse, still extant in at least three MSS.
under the title of the "Dialogue of the Two Sages,"<a name="FNanchor_3_373" id="FNanchor_3_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_373" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was so
learned, and they contended with one another in terms so
abstruse that, as the chronicler in the Book of Ballymote
puts it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Obscure to every one seemed the speech which the poets uttered
in that discussion, and the legal decision which they delivered was
not clear to the kings and to the other poets.</p>

<p>"'These men alone,' said the kings, 'have their judgment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
their skill, and their knowledge. In the first place we do not
understand what they say.'</p>

<p>"'Well, then,' said Conor, 'every one shall have his share therein
from to-day for ever.'"<a name="FNanchor_4_374" id="FNanchor_4_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_374" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This was the occasion upon which Conor made the law that
the office of poet should no longer carry with it, of necessity,
the office of judge, for, says the ancient writer, "poets alone
had judicature from the time that Amairgin Whiteknee
delivered the first judgment in Erin" until then.</p>

<p>That the Bardic schools, which we know flourished as public
institutions with scarcely a break from the Synod of Drumceat
in 590 (where regular lands were set apart for their endowment)
down to the seventeenth century, were really a
continuation of the Druidic schools, and embodied much that
was purely pagan in their curricula, is, I think, amply shown
by the curious fragments of metrical text-books preserved in
the Books of Leinster and Ballymote, in a MS. in Trinity
College, and in a MS. in the Bodleian, all four of which have
been recently admirably edited by Thurneysen as a continuous
text.<a name="FNanchor_5_375" id="FNanchor_5_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_375" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He has not however ventured upon a translation, for
the scholar would be indeed a bold one who in the present state
of Celtic scholarship would attempt a complete interpretation
of tracts so antique and difficult. That they date, partially at
least, from pre-Christian times seems to me certain from their
prescribing amongst other things for the poet's course in one
of his years of study a knowledge of the magical incantations
called <i>Tenmlaida, Imbas forosnai,</i><a name="FNanchor_6_376" id="FNanchor_6_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_376" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and <i>Dichetal do chennaib na
tuaithe</i>, and making him in another year learn a certain poem
or incantation called <i>Cétnad</i>, of which the text says that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is used for finding out a theft. One sings it, that is to say,
through the right fist on the track of the stolen beast" [observe the
antique assumption that the only kind of wealth to be stolen is cattle]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
"or on the track of the thief, in case the beast is dead. And one sings
it three times on the one [track] or the other. If, however, one
does not find the track, one sings it through the right fist, and goes
to sleep upon it, and in one's sleep the man who has brought it
away is clearly shown and made known. Another virtue [of this
lay]: one speaks it into the right palm and rubs with it the quarters
of the horse before one mounts it, and the horse will not be overthrown,
and the man will not be thrown off or wounded."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another <i>Cétnad</i> to be learned by the poet, in which he
desires length of life, is addressed to "the seven daughters of
the sea, who shape the thread of the long-lived children."</p>

<p>Another with which he had to make himself familiar was the
<i>Glam dichinn</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_377" id="FNanchor_7_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_377" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> intended to satirise and punish the prince who
refused to a poet the reward of his poem. The poet&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"was to fast upon the lands of the king for whom the poem was to
be made, and the consent of thirty laymen, thirty bishops"&mdash;a
Christian touch to make the passage pass muster&mdash;"and thirty poets
should be had to compose the satire; <i>and it was a crime to them to
prevent it when the reward of the poem was withheld</i>"&mdash;a pagan touch
as a make-weight on the other side! "The poet then, in a company
of seven, that is, six others and himself, upon whom six poetic
degrees had been conferred, namely a <i>focloc, macfuirmedh, doss, cana,
clí, anradh,</i> and <i>ollamh</i>, went at the rising of the sun to a hill which
should be situated on the boundary of seven lands, and each of them
was to turn his face to a different land, and the <i>ollamh's</i> (ollav's) face
was to be turned to the land of the king, who was to be satirised,
and their backs should be turned to a hawthorn which should be
growing upon the top of a hill, and the wind should be blowing from
the north, and each man was to hold a perforated stone and a thorn
of the hawthorn in his hand, and each man was to sing a verse of
this composition for the king&mdash;the <i>ollamh</i> or chief poet to take the
lead with his own verse, and the others in concert after him with
theirs; and each then should place his stone and his thorn under
the stem of the hawthorn, and if it was they that were in the
wrong in the case, the ground of the hill would swallow them, and
if it was the king that was in the wrong, the ground would swallow
him and his wife, and his son and his steed, and his robes and his
hound. The satire of the <i>macfuirmedh</i> fell on the hound, the satire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
of the <i>focloc</i> on the robes, the satire of the <i>doss</i> on the arms, the
satire of the <i>cana</i> on the wife, the satire of the <i>clí</i> on the son, the
satire of the <i>anrad</i> on the steed,<a name="FNanchor_8_378" id="FNanchor_8_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_378" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the satire of the <i>ollamh</i> on the
king."</p></blockquote>

<p>These instances that I have mentioned occurring in the
books of the poets' instruction, are evidently remains of magic
incantations and terrifying magic ceremonies, taken over from
the schools and times of the druids, and carried on into the
Christian era, for nobody, I imagine, could contend that they
had their origin after Ireland had been Christianised.<a name="FNanchor_9_379" id="FNanchor_9_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_379" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And
the occurrence in the poets' text-books of such evidently pagan
passages, side by side with allusions to Athairné the poet&mdash;a
contemporary of Conor mac Nessa, a little before the birth of
Christ, Caoilte, the Fenian poet of the third century, Cormac
his contemporary, <i>Laidcend mac Bairchida</i> about the year
400, and others&mdash;seems to me to be fresh proof for the real
objective existence of these characters. For if part of the
poets' text-books can be thus shown to have preserved things
taught in the pre-Christian times&mdash;to be in fact actually pre-Christian&mdash;why
should we doubt the reality of the pre-Christian
persons mixed up with them?</p>

<p>The first poem written in Ireland by a Milesian is said to
be the curious rhapsody of Amergin the brother of Eber, Ir,
and Erimon, who on landing broke out in a strain of
exultation:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I am the wind which breathes upon the sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the wave of the ocean,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the murmur of the billows,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the ox of the seven combats,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the vulture upon the rock,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am a beam of the sun,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the fairest of plants,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am a wild boar in valour,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am a salmon in the water,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am a lake in the plain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am a word of science,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the point of the lance of battle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the god who creates in the head [<i>i.e.</i>, of man] the fire [<i>i.e.</i>, the thought]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who is it who throws light into the meeting on the mountain?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who announces the ages of the moon [if not I]?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who teaches the place where couches the sea [if not I]?"<a name="FNanchor_10_380" id="FNanchor_10_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_380" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>There are two more poems attributed to Amergin of much
the same nature, very ancient and very strange. Irish
tradition has always represented these poems as the first made
by our ancestors in Ireland, and no doubt they do actually
represent the oldest surviving lines in the vernacular of any
country in Europe except Greece alone.</p>

<p>The other pre-Christian poets<a name="FNanchor_11_381" id="FNanchor_11_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_381" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of whom we hear most, and
to whom certain surviving fragments are ascribed, are Feirceirtné,
surnamed <i>filé</i>, or the poet, who is usually credited with
the authorship of the well-known grammatical treatise called
<i>Uraicept na n-Éigeas</i> or "Primer of the Learned."<a name="FNanchor_12_382" id="FNanchor_12_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_382" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It was he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
who contended with Neidé for the arch-poet's robe, causing King
Conor to decide that no poet should in future be also of necessity
a judge. The Uraicept begins with this preface or introduction:
"The Book of Feirceirtné here. Its place Emania; its time
the time of Conor mac Nessa; its person Feirceirtné the poet;
its cause to bring ignorant people to knowledge." There is
also a poem attributed to him on the death of Curoi mac
Daire, the great southern chieftain, whom Cuchulain slew,
and the Book of Invasions contains a valuable poem ascribed to
him, recounting how Ollamh Fódla, a monarch who is said to
have flourished many centuries before, established a college of
professors at Tara.</p>

<p>There was a poet called Adhna, the father of that Neidé
with whom Feirceirtné contended for the poet's robe,
who also lived at the court of Conor mac Nessa, and his
name is mentioned in connection with some fragments of
laws.</p>

<p>Athairné, the overbearing insolent satirist from the Hill
of Howth, who figures largely in Irish romance, was
contemporaneous with these, though I do not know that
any poem is attributed to him. But he and a poet
called Forchern, with Feirceirtné and Neidé, are said to
have compiled a code of laws, now embodied with others
under the title of <i>Breithe Neimhidh</i> in the Brehon Law
Books.</p>

<p>There was a poet Lughar at the Court of Oilioll and Mève
in Connacht about the same time, and a poem on the descendants
of Fergus mac Róigh [Roy] is ascribed to him, but as
he was contemporaneous with that warrior he could not have
written about his descendants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a prose tract called Moran's Will,<a name="FNanchor_13_383" id="FNanchor_13_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_383" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> ascribed to
Moran, a well-known jurist who lived at the close of the first
century.</p>

<p>Several other authors, either of short poems or law fragments,
are mentioned in the second and third centuries, such
as Feradach king of Ireland, Modan, Ciothruadh the poet,
Fingin, Oilioll Olum himself, the great king of Munster, to
whom are traced so many of the southern families. Fithil, a
judge, and perhaps some others, none of whom need be
particularised.</p>

<p>At the end of the third century we come upon three or
four names of vast repute in Irish history, into whose mouths
a quantity of pieces are put, most of which are evidently of
later date. These are the great Cormac mac Art himself,
the most striking king that ever reigned in pagan Ireland, he
who built those palaces on Tara Hill whose ruins still remain;
Finn mac Cúmhail his son-in-law and captain; Ossian, Finn's
son; Fergus, Ossian's brother; and Caoilte [Cweeltya] mac
Ronáin.</p>

<p>The poetry ascribed to Finn mac Cúmhail, Ossian, and the
other Fenian singers we will not examine in this place, but
we must not pass by one of the most remarkable prose tracts
of ancient Ireland with which I am acquainted, the famous
treatise ascribed to King Cormac, and well known in Irish
literature as the "Teagasg ríogh," or Instruction of a Prince,
which is written in a curious style, by way of question and
answer. Cairbré, Cormac's son, he who afterwards fell out
with and overthrew the Fenians, is supposed to be learning
kingly wisdom at his father's feet, and that experienced monarch
instructs him in the pagan morality of the time, and gives
him all kinds of information and advice. The piece, which is
heavily glossed in the Book of Ballymote, on account of the
antiquity of the language, is of some length, and is far too
interesting to pass by without quoting from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<h4>THE INSTRUCTION OF A PRINCE.</h4>


<p>"'O grandson of Con, O Cormac,' said Cairbré, 'what is good for
a king.'<a name="FNanchor_14_384" id="FNanchor_14_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_384" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>"'That is plain,' said Cormac, 'it is good for him to have patience
and not to dispute, self-government without anger, affability without
haughtiness, diligent attention to history, strict observance of covenants
and agreements, strictness mitigated by mercy in the execution
of laws.... It is good for him [to make] fertile land, to invite ships
to import jewels of price across sea, to purchase and bestow raiment,
[to keep] vigorous swordsmen for protecting his territories, [to make]
war outside his own territories, to attend the sick, to discipline his
soldiers ... let him enforce fear, let him perfect peace, [let him]
give much of metheglin and wine, let him pronounce just judgments
of light, let him speak all truth, for it is through the truth of a king
that God gives favourable seasons.'</p>

<p>"'O grandson of Con, O Cormac,' said Cairbré, 'what is good for
the welfare of a country?'</p>

<p>"'That is plain,' said Cormac, 'frequent convocations of sapient
and good men to investigate its affairs, to abolish each evil and
retain each wholesome institution, to attend to the precepts of the
elders; let every assembly be convened according to law, let the
law be in the hands of the nobles, let the chieftains be upright and
unwilling to oppress the poor,'" etc., etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>A more interesting passage is the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'O grandson of Con, O Cormac, what are the duties of a prince
at a banqueting-house?'</p>

<p>"'A Prince on Samhan's [now All Souls] Day, should light his
lamps, and welcome his guests with clapping of hands, procure
comfortable seats, the cupbearers should be respectable and active
in the distribution of meat and drink. Let there be moderation of
music, short stories, a welcoming countenance, a welcome for the
learned, pleasant conversations, and the like, these are the duties of
the prince, and the arrangement of the banqueting-house.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>After this Cairbré puts an important question which was
asked often enough during the period of the Brehon law, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
which for over a thousand years scarce ever received a different
answer. He asks, "For what qualifications is a king elected
over countries and tribes of people?"</p>

<p>Cormac in his answer embodies the views of every clan in
Ireland in their practical choice of a leader.</p>

<p>"From the goodness of his shape and family, from his experience
and wisdom, from his prudence and magnanimity, from
his eloquence and bravery in battle, and from the number of his
friends."</p>

<p>After this follows a long description of the qualifications of a
prince, and Cairbré having heard it puts this question:&mdash;"O
grandson of Con, what was <i>thy</i> deportment when a youth;"
to which he receives the following striking answer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I was cheerful at the Banquet of the Midh-chuarta [Mee-cuarta,
"house of the circulation of mead"], fierce in battle, but vigilant and
circumspect. I was kind to friends, a physician to the sick, merciful
towards the weak, stern towards the headstrong. Although possessed
of knowledge, I was inclined towards taciturnity.<a name="FNanchor_15_385" id="FNanchor_15_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_385" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Although strong
I was not haughty. I mocked not the old although I was young. I
was not vain although I was valiant. When I spoke of a person in
his absence I praised, not defamed him, for it is by these customs
that we are known to be courteous and civilised (<i>riaghalach</i>).'"</p></blockquote>

<p>There is an extremely beautiful answer given later on by
Cormac to the rather simple question of his son:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'O grandson of Con, what is good for me?'</p>

<p>"'If thou attend to my command,' answers Cormac, 'thou wilt not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
mock the old although thou art young, nor the poor although thou
art well-clad, nor the lame although thou art agile, nor the blind
although thou art clear-sighted, nor the feeble although thou art
strong, nor the ignorant although thou art learned. Be not slothful,
nor passionate, nor penurious, nor idle, nor jealous, for he who is so
is an object of hatred to God as well as to man.'"</p>

<p>"'O grandson of Con,' asks Cairbré, in another place, 'I would
fain know how I am to conduct myself among the wise and among
the foolish, among friends and among strangers, among the old and
among the young,' and to this question his father gives this notable
response.</p>

<p>"'Be not too knowing nor too simple; be not proud, be not inactive,
be not too humble nor yet haughty; be not talkative but be not too
silent; be not timid neither be severe. For if thou shouldest appear
too knowing thou wouldst be satirised and abused; if too simple
thou wouldst be imposed upon; if too proud thou wouldst be
shunned; if too humble thy dignity would suffer; if talkative thou
wouldst not be deemed learned; if too severe thy character would
be defamed; if too timid thy rights would be encroached upon.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>To the curious question, "O grandson of Con, what are the
most lasting things in the world?" the equally curious and to
me unintelligible answer is returned, "Grass, copper, and yew."</p>

<p>Of women, King Cormac, like so many monarchs from
Solomon down, has nothing good to say, perhaps his high
position did not help him to judge them impartially. At least,
to the question, "O grandson of Con, how shall I distinguish
the characters of women?" the following bitter answer is
given:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I know them, but I cannot describe them. Their counsel is
foolish, they are forgetful of love, most headstrong in their desires,
fond of folly, prone to enter rashly into engagements, given to
swearing, proud to be asked in marriage, tenacious of enmity, cheerless
at the banquet, rejectors of reconciliation, prone to strife, of
much garrulity. Until evil be good, until hell be heaven, until the sun
hide his light, until the stars of heaven fall, women will remain as we
have stated. Woe to him, my son, who desires or serves a bad
woman, woe to every one who has got a bad wife'"!</p></blockquote>

<p>This Christian allusion to heaven and hell, and some others
of the same sort, show that despite a considerable pagan flavouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the tract cannot be entirely the work of King Cormac,
though it may very well be the embodiment and extension of an
ancient pagan discourse, for, as we have seen, after Christianity
had succeeded in getting the upper hand over paganism, a kind
of tacit compromise was arrived at, by means of which the
bards and <i>f&#301;lès</i> and other representatives of the old pagan
learning, were allowed to continue to propagate their stories,
tales, poems, and genealogies, at the price of incorporating with
them a small share of Christian alloy, or, to use a different
simile, just as the vessels of some feudatory nations are compelled
to fly at the mast-head the flag of the suzerain power. But so
badly has the dovetailing of the Christian and the pagan parts
been managed in most of the older romances, that the pieces
come away quite separate in the hands of even the least skilled
analyser, and the pagan substratum stands forth entirely distinct
from the Christian accretion.</p>

<h4>THE SUGGESTIVELY PAGAN ELEMENT IN IRISH LITERATURE</h4>


<p>It is this easy analysis of early Irish literature into its ante-Christian
and its post-Christian elements, which lends to it its
absorbing value and interest. For when all spurious accretions
have been stripped off, we find in the most ancient Irish poems
and sagas, a genuine picture of pagan life in Europe, such as
we look for in vain elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Church," writes Windisch, "adopted towards pagan sagas,
the same position that it adopted towards pagan law.... I see
no sufficient ground for doubting that really genuine pictures of
a pre-Christian culture are preserved to us in the individual sagas,
pictures which are of course in some places faded, and in others
painted over by a later hand."<a name="FNanchor_1_386" id="FNanchor_1_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_386" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Again in his notes on the story of Déirdre, he remarks&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The saga originated in pagan, and was propagated in Christian
times, and that too without its seeking fresh nutriment as a rule from
Christian elements. But we must ascribe it to the influence of
Christianity that what is specifically pagan in Irish saga is blurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
over and forced into the background. And yet there exist many
whose contents are plainly mythological. The Christian monks were
certainly <i>not the first</i> who reduced the ancient sagas to fixed form,
but later on they copied them faithfully, and propagated them after
Ireland had been converted to Christianity."</p></blockquote>

<p>Zimmer too has come to the same conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nothing," he writes, "except a spurious criticism which takes
for original and primitive the most palpable nonsense of which
Middle-Irish writers from the twelfth to the sixteenth century are
guilty with regard to their own antiquity, which is in many respects
strange and foreign to them: nothing but such a criticism can, on
the other hand, make the attempt to doubt of the historical character
of the chief persons of the Saga cycles.<a name="FNanchor_2_387" id="FNanchor_2_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_387" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For we believe that Mève,
Conor mac Nessa, Cuchulain, and Finn mac Cúmhail, are exactly as
much historical personalities as Arminius, or Dietrich of Bern, or
Etzel, and their date is just as well determined as that of the above-mentioned
heroes and kings, who are glorified in song by the
Germans, even though, in the case of Irish heroes and kings, external
witnesses are wanting.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>M. d'Arbois de Jubainville expresses himself in like terms.
"We have no reason," he writes, "to doubt of the reality of
the principal <i>rôle</i> in this [cycle of Cuchulain];"<a name="FNanchor_3_388" id="FNanchor_3_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_388" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and of the
story of the Boru tribute which was imposed on Leinster about
a century later; he writes, "Le récit a pour base des faits réels,
quoique certains détails aient été créés par l'imagination;" and
again, "Irish epic story, barbarous though it is, is, like Irish
law, a monument of a civilisation far superior to that of the
most ancient Germans; if the Roman idea of the state was
wanting to that civilisation, and, if that defect in it was a
radical flaw, still there is an intellectual culture to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
there, far more developed than amongst the primitive
Germans.'"<a name="FNanchor_4_389" id="FNanchor_4_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_389" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ireland, in fact," writes M. Darmesteter in his "English Studies,"
well summing up the legitimate conclusions from the works of the
great Celtic scholars, "has the peculiar privilege of a history continuous
from the earliest centuries of our era until the present day.
She has preserved in the infinite wealth of her literature a complete
and faithful picture of the ancient civilisation of the Celts. Irish
literature is therefore the key which opens the Celtic world."</p></blockquote>

<p>But the Celtic world means a large portion of Europe, and
the key to unlock the door of its past history is in the Irish
manuscripts of saga and poem. Without them the student
would have to view the past history of Europe through the distorting
glasses of the Greeks and Romans, to whom all outer
nations were barbarians, into whose social life they had no
motive for inquiring. He would have no other means of
estimating what were the feelings, modes of life, manners, and
habits, of those great races who possessed so large a part of the
ancient world, Gaul, Belgium, North Italy, parts of Germany,
Spain, Switzerland, and the British Isles; who burned Rome,
plundered Greece, and colonised Asia Minor. But in the
Irish romances and historical sagas, he sees come to light
another standard by which to measure. Through this early
Irish peep-hole he gets a clear look at the life and manners
of the race in one of its strongholds, from which he may
conjecture and even assume a good deal with regard to
the others.</p>

<p>That the pictures of social life and early society drawn in
the Irish romances represent phases not common to the
Irish alone, but to large portions of that Celtic race which
once owned so much of Europe, may be surmised with some
certainty from the way in which characteristics of the Celts
barely mentioned by Greek and Roman writers re-appear
amongst the Irish in all the intimate detail and fond expansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
of romance. M. d'Arbois de Jubainville has drawn attention
to many such instances.</p>

<p>Posidonius, who was a friend of Cicero, and wrote about a
hundred years before Christ, mentions a custom which existed
in Gaul in his time of fighting at a feast for the best bit which
was to be given to the most valiant warrior. This custom,
briefly noticed by Posidonius, might be passed by unnoticed by
the ordinary reader, but the Irish one will remember the early
romances of his race in which the <i>curadh-mir</i> or "heroes' bit"
so largely figures. He will remember that it is upon this
custom that one of the greatest sagas of the Cuchulain cycle,
the feast of Bricriu, hinges. Bricriu, the Thersites of the
Red Branch, having built a new and magnificent house,
determines to invite King Conor and the other chieftains to
a feast, for the house was very magnificent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The dining hall was built like that of the High-king at Tara.
From the hearth to the wall were nine beds, and each of the side
walls was thirty-five feet high and covered with ornaments of gilt
bronze. Against one of the side walls of that palace was reared a
royal bed destined for Conor,<a name="FNanchor_5_390" id="FNanchor_5_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_390" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> king of Ulster, which looked down
upon all the others. It was ornamented with carbuncles and precious
stones and other gems of great price. The gold and silver and
all sorts of jewellery which covered that bed shone with such splendour
that the night was as brilliant as the day."</p></blockquote>

<p>He had prepared a magnificent <i>curadh-mir</i> for the feast,
consisting of a seven-year old pig, and a seven-year old cow
that had been fed on milk and corn and the finest food since their
birth, a hundred cakes of corn cooked with honey&mdash;and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
four cakes took a sack of corn to make them&mdash;and a vat of
wine large enough to hold three of the warriors of the
Ultonians. This magnificent "heroes' bit" he secretly promises
to each of three warriors in turn, Laeghaire [Leary],
Conall Cearnach, and Cuchulain, hoping to excite a quarrel
among them. On the result of his expedient the saga
turns.<a name="FNanchor_6_391" id="FNanchor_6_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_391" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Again, Cæsar tells us that when he invaded the Gauls they
did not fight any longer in chariots, but it is recorded that they
did so fight two hundred years before his time, even as the Persians
fought against the Greeks, and as the Greeks themselves must
have fought in a still earlier age commemorated by Homer. But
in the Irish sagas we find this epic mode of warfare in full force.
Every great man has his charioteer, they fight from their cars
as in Homeric days, and much is told us of both steed, chariot
and driver. In the above-mentioned saga of Bricriu's feast it
is the charioteers of the three warriors who claim the heroes'
bit for their masters, since they are apparently ashamed to make
the first move themselves. The charioteer was more than a
mere servant. Cuchulain sometimes calls his charioteer friend
or master (popa), and on the occasion of his fight with Ferdiad
desires him in case he (Cuchulain) should show signs of
yielding, to "excite reproach and speak evil to me so that the
ire of my rage and anger should grow the more on me, but if
he give ground before me thou shalt laud me and praise me and
speak good words to me that my courage may be the greater,"
and this command his friend and charioteer punctually
executes.</p>

<p>The chariot itself is in many places graphically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
described. Here is how its approach is pourtrayed in the
Táin&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was not long," says the chronicler, "until Ferdiad's charioteer
heard the noise approaching, the clamour and the rattle, and the
whistling, and the tramp, and the thunder, and the clatter and the
roar, namely the shield-noise of the light shields, and the hissing of
the spears, and the loud clangour of the swords, and the tinkling of
the helmet, and the ringing of the armour, and the friction of the
arms; the dangling of the missive weapons, the straining of the
ropes, and the loud clattering of the wheels, and the creaking of the
chariot, and the trampling of the horses, and the triumphant advance
of the champion and the warrior towards the ford approaching him."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the romance called the "Intoxication of the Ultonians,"
it is mentioned that they drave so fast in the wake of Cuchulain,
that "the iron wheels of the chariots cut the roots of the
immense trees." Here is how the romancist describes the
advance of such a body upon Tara-Luachra.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Not long were they there, the two watchers and the two druids,
until a full fierce rush of the first band broke hither past the glen.
Such was the fury with which they advanced that there was not left
a spear on a rack, nor a shield on a spike, nor a sword in an armoury
in Tara-Luachra that did not fall down. From every house on which
was thatch in Tara-Luachra it fell in immense flakes. One would
think that it was the sea that had come over the walls and over the
corners of the world upon them. The forms of countenances were
changed, and there was chattering of teeth in Tara-Luachra within.
The two druids fell in fits and in faintings and in paroxysms, one of
them out over the wall and the other over the wall inside."</p></blockquote>

<p>On another occasion the approach of Cuchulain's chariot is
thus described&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Like a mering were the two dykes which the iron wheels of
Cuchulain's chariot made on that day of the sides of the road. Like
flocks of dark birds pouring over a vast plain were the blocks and
round sods and turves of the earth which the horses would cast away
behind them against the ... of the wind. Like a flock of swans
pouring over a vast plain was the foam which they flung before them
over the muzzles of their bridles. Like the smoke from a royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
hostel was the dust and breath of the dense vapour, because of the
vehemence of the driving which Liag, son of Riangabhra, on that
day gave to the two steeds of Cuchulain."<a name="FNanchor_7_392" id="FNanchor_7_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_392" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Elsewhere the chariot itself is described as "wythe-wickered,
two bright bronze wheels, a white pole of bright silver with a
veining of white bronze, a very high creaking body, having its
firm sloping sides ornamented with <i>cred</i> (tin?), a back-arched
rich golden yoke, two rich yellow-peaked <i>alls</i>, hardened sword-straight
axle-spindles." Laeghaire's chariot is described in
another piece as "a chariot wythe-wickered, two firm black
wheels, two pliant beautiful reins, hardened sword-straight
axle-spindles, a new fresh-polished body, a back-arched rich
silver-mounted yoke, two rich-yellow peaked <i>alls</i> ... a bird
plume of the usual feathers over the body of the chariot."<a name="FNanchor_8_393" id="FNanchor_8_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_393" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Descriptions like these are constantly occurring in the Irish
tales, and enable us to realise better the heroic period of warfare
and to fill up in our imagination many a long-regretted lacuna
in our knowledge of primitive Europe.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Those philosophers," says Diodorus Siculus, a Greek writer of
the Augustan age, speaking of the Druids, "like the lyric poets
called bards, have a great authority both in affairs of peace and war,
friends and enemies listen to them. Also when the two armies are
in presence of one another and swords drawn and spears couched,
they throw themselves into the midst of the combatants and appease
them as though they were charming wild beasts. Thus even
amongst the most savage barbarians anger submits to the rule of
wisdom, and the god of war pays homage to the Muses."</p></blockquote>

<p>To show that the manners and customs of the Keltoi or Celts
of whom Diodorus speaks were in this respect identical with
those of their Irish cousins (or brothers), and to give another
instance of the warm light shed by Irish literature upon the
early customs of Western Europe I shall convert the abstract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
into the concrete by a page or two from an Irish romance, not
an old one,<a name="FNanchor_9_394" id="FNanchor_9_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_394" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but one which no doubt preserves many original
traditionary traits. In this story Finn mac Cúmhail or Cool<a name="FNanchor_10_395" id="FNanchor_10_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_395" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
at a great feast in his fort at Allen asks Goll about some tribute
which he claimed, and is dissatisfied at the answer of Goll, who
may be called the Ajax of the Fenians. After that there arose
a quarrel at the feast, the rise of which is thus graphically
pourtrayed&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Goll,' said Finn, 'you have acknowledged in that speech that
you came from the city of Beirbhé to the battle of Cnoca, and that
you slew my father there, and it is a bold and disobedient thing of
you to tell me that,' said Finn.</p>

<p>"'By my hand, O Finn,' said Goll, 'if you were to dishonour me
as your father did, I would give you the same payment that I gave
Cool.'</p>

<p>"'Goll,' said Finn, 'I would be well able not to let that word pass
with you, for I have a hundred valiant warriors in my following for
every one that is in yours.'</p>

<p>"'Your father had that also,' said Goll, 'and yet I avenged my
dishonour on him, and I would do the same to you if you were to
deserve it of me.'</p>

<p>"White-skinned Carroll O Baoisgne<a name="FNanchor_11_396" id="FNanchor_11_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_396" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> spake, and 't is what he said:
'O Goll,' said he, 'there is many a man,' said he, 'to silence you and
your people in the household of Finn mac Cúmhail.'</p>

<p>"Bald cursing Conan mac Morna spake, and 't is what he said, 'I
swear by my arms of valour,' said he, 'that Goll, the day he has least
men, has a man and a hundred in his household, and not a man of
them but would silence you.'</p>

<p>"'Are you one of those, perverse, bald-headed Conan?' said
Carroll.</p>

<p>"'I am one of them, black-visaged, nail-torn, skin-scratched, little-strength
Carroll,' says Conan, 'and I would soon prove it to you that
Cúmhail was in the wrong.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was then that Carroll arose, and he struck a daring fist, quick
and ready, upon Conan, and there was no submission in Conan's
answer, for he struck the second fist on Carroll in the middle of his
face and his teeth."</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon this the chronicler relates how first one joined in and
then another, until at last all the adherents of Goll and Finn
and even the captains themselves are hard at work. "After
that," he adds, "bad was the place for a mild, smooth-fingered
woman or a weak or infirm person, or an aged, long-lived
elder." This terrific fight continued "from the beginning of
the night till the rising of the sun in the morning," and was
only stopped&mdash;just as Diodorus says battles were stopped&mdash;by
the intervention of the bards.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was then," says the romancist, "that the prophesying poet of
the pointed words, that guerdon-full good man of song, Fergus
Finnbheóil, rose up, and all the Fenians' men of science along with
him, and they sang their hymns and good poems, and their perfect
lays to those heroes to silence and to soften them. It was then they
ceased from their slaughtering and maiming, on hearing the music
of the poets, and they let their weapons fall to earth, and the poets
took up their weapons and they went between them, and grasped
them with the grasp of reconciliation."</p></blockquote>

<p>When the palace was cleared out it was found that 1,100 of
Finn's people had been killed between men and women, and
eleven men and fifty women of Goll's party.</p>

<p>Cæsar speaks of the numbers who frequented the schools of
the druids in Gaul; "it is said," he adds, "that they learn
there a great number of verses, and that is why some of those
pupils spend twenty years in learning. It is not, according to
the druids, permissible to entrust verses to writing although
they use the Greek alphabet in all other affairs public and
private." Of this prohibition to commit their verses to paper,
we have no trace, so far as I know, in our literature, but the
accounts of the early bardic schools entirely bear out the
description here given of them by Cæsar, and again shows the
solidarity of custom which seems to have existed between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
various Celtic tribes. According to our early manuscripts it
took from nine to twelve years for a student to take the
highest degree at the bardic schools, and in many cases where
the pupil failed to master sufficiently the subjects of the year,
he had probably to spend two over it, so that it is quite possible
that some might spend twenty years over their learning. And
much of this learning was, as Cæsar notes, in verse. Many
earlier law tracts appear to have been so, and even many of the
earliest romances. There is a very interesting account extant
called the "Proceedings of the Great Bardic Association,"
which leads up to the Epic of the Táin Bo Chuailgne, the
greatest of the Irish romances, according to which this great
tale was at one time lost, and the great Bardic Institution was
commanded to hunt for and recover it. The fact of it being
said that the perfect tale was lost for ever "and that only a
fragmentary and broken form of it would go down to posterity"
perhaps indicates, as has been pointed out by Sullivan, "that
the filling up the gaps in the poem by prose narrative is
meant." In point of fact the tale, as we have it now, consists
half of verse and half of prose. Nor is this peculiar to the
Táin. Most of the oldest and many of the modern tales are
composed in this way. In most cases the verse is of a more
archaic character and more difficult than the prose. In very
many an expanded prose narrative of several pages is followed
by a more condensed poem saying the same thing. So much
did the Irish at last come to look upon it as a matter of course
that every romance should be interspersed with poetry, that
even writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
who consciously invented their stories as a modern novelist
invents his, have interspersed their pieces with passages, in
verse, as did Comyn in his Turlough mac Stairn, as did the
author of the Son of Ill-counsel, the author of the Parliament of
Clan Lopus, the author of the Women's Parliament, and others.
We may take it, then, that in the earliest days the romances
were composed in verse and learned by heart by the students&mdash;possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
before any alphabet was known at all; afterwards
when lacunæ occurred through defective memory on the part
of the reciter he filled up the gaps with prose. Those who
committed to paper our earliest tales wrote down as much of
the old poetry as they could recollect or had access to, and
wrote the connecting narrative in prose. Hence it soon came
to pass that if a story pretended to any antiquity it had to be
interspersed with verses, and at last it happened that the Irish
taste became so confirmed to this style of writing that authors
adopted it, as I have said, even in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>In spite of the mythological and phantastic elements which
are undoubtedly mingled with the oldest sagas,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"the manners and customs in which the men of the time lived
and moved, are depicted," writes Windisch,<a name="FNanchor_12_397" id="FNanchor_12_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_397" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> "with a naïve realism
which leaves no room for doubt as to the former actuality of the
scenes depicted. In matter of costume and weapons, eating and
drinking, building and arrangement of the banqueting-hall, manners
observed at the feast, and much more, we find here the most valuable
information." "I insist upon it," he says in another place, "that
Irish saga is the only richly-flowing source of unbroken Celtism."</p></blockquote>

<p>All the remaining linguistic monuments of Breton, Cornish,
and Welsh, "would form," writes M. d'Arbois de Jubainville,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"un ensemble bien incomplet et bien obscur sans la lumière que
la littérature irlandaise projette sur ces débris. C'est le vieil irlandais
qui forme le trait d'union pour ainsi dire entre les dialectes neo-celtiques
de la fin du moyen âge ou des temps modernes, et le
Gaulois des inscriptions lapidaires, des monnaies, des noms propres
conservés par la littérature grecque et la littérature romaine."<a name="FNanchor_13_398" id="FNanchor_13_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_398" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It may, then, be finally acknowledged that those of the great
nations of to-day, whose ancestors were mostly Celts, but
whose language, literature, and traditions have completely disappeared,
must, if they wish to study their own past, turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
themselves first to Ireland. When we find so much of the
brief and scanty information given us by the classics, not only
borne out, but amply illustrated by old Irish literature, when
we find the dry bones of Posidonius and Cæsar rise up again
before us with a ruddy covering of flesh and blood, it is not
too much to surmise that in other matters also the various
Celtic races bore to each other a close resemblance.</p>

<p>Much more could be said upon this subject, as that the four
Gallo-Roman inscriptions to Brigantia found in Great Britain
are really to the Goddess Brigit;<a name="FNanchor_14_399" id="FNanchor_14_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_399" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that the Brennus who
burned Rome 390 years before Christ and the Brennus who
stormed Delphi 110 years later were only the god Brian,
under whose tutelage the Gauls marched; and that Lugudunum,
Lugh's Dún or fortress, is so-called from the god
Lugh the Long-handed, to whom two Celtic inscriptions are
found, one in Spain and one in Switzerland, as may be seen
set forth at length in the volumes of Monsieur d'Arbois de
Jubainville.</p>

<h4>THE OLDEST BOOKS AND POEMS</h4>


<p>The books of saga, poetry, and annals that have come down to
our day, though so vastly more ancient and numerous than
anything that the rest of Western Europe has to show, are
yet an almost inappreciable fragment of the literature that at
one time existed in Ireland. The great native scholar O'Curry,
who possessed a unique and unrivalled knowledge of Irish
literature in all its forms, has drawn up a list of lost books
which may be supposed to have contained our earliest literature.</p>

<p>We find the poet Senchan Torpéist&mdash;according to the
account in the Book of Leinster, a manuscript which dates
from about the year 1150&mdash;complaining that the only perfect
record of the great Irish epic, the Táin Bo Chuailgne<a name="FNanchor_1_400" id="FNanchor_1_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_400" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or
Cattle-spoil of Cooley, had been taken to the East with the
Cuilmenn,<a name="FNanchor_2_401" id="FNanchor_2_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_401" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or Great Skin Book. Now Zimmer, who made
a special and minute study of this story, considers that the
earliest redaction of the Táin dates from the seventh century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
This legend about Senchan&mdash;a real historical poet whose
eulogy in praise of Columcille, whether genuine or not,
was widely popular&mdash;is probably equally old, and points to
the early existence of a great skin book in which pagan
tales were written, but which was then lost. The next
great book is the celebrated Saltair of Tara, which is alluded
to in a genuine poem of Cuan O'Lochain about the year
1000, in which he says that Cormac mac Art drew up the
Saltair of Tara. Cormac, being a pagan, could not have
called the book a Saltair or Psalterium, but it may have got the
name in later times from its being in metre. All that this
really proves, however, is that there then existed a book about
the prerogatives of Tara and the provincial kings so old that
Cuan O'Lochain&mdash;no doubt following tradition&mdash;was not
afraid to ascribe it to Cormac mac Art who lived in the third
century. The next lost book is called the Book of the
Uacongbhail, upon which both the O'Clerys in their Book
of Invasions and Keating in his history drew, and which,
according to O'Curry, still existed at Kildare so late as 1626.
The next book is called the Cin of Drom Snechta. It is
quoted in the Leabhar na h-Uidhre, or "Book of the Dun
Cow"&mdash;a MS. of about the year 1100&mdash;and often in the Book
of Ballymote and by Keating, who in quoting it says, "And
it was before the coming of Patrick to Ireland that that book
existed,"<a name="FNanchor_3_402" id="FNanchor_3_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_402" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the Book of Leinster ascribes it to the son
of a king of Connacht who died either in 379 or 499. The
next books of which we find mention were said to have
belonged to St. Longarad, a contemporary of St. Columcille.
The scribe who wrote the glosses on the Féil&#301;rè of Angus the
Culdee, said that the books existed still in his day, but that
nobody could read them; for which he accounts by the tale
that Columcille once paid Longarad a visit in order to see his
books, but that his host refused to show them, and that Columcille
then said, "May your books be of no use after you, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
you have exercised inhospitality about them." On account of
this the books became illegible after Longarad's death. Angus
the Culdee lived about the year 800, but Stokes ascribes the
Féil&#301;rè to the tenth century; a view, however, which Mr.
Strachan's studies on the Irish deponent verb, which is of such
frequent occurrence in the Féil&#301;rè, may perhaps modify. At
what time the scholiast wrote his note on the text is uncertain,
but it also is very old. It is plain, then, that at this time a
number of illegible books&mdash;illegible no doubt from age&mdash;existed;
and to account for this illegibility the story of Columcille's
curse was invented. The Annals of Ulster quote another
book at the year 527 under the name of the Book of St.
Mochta, who was a disciple of St. Patrick. They also quote
the Book of Cuana at the year 468 and repeatedly afterwards
down to the year 610, while they record the death of Cuana,
a scribe, at the year 738, after which no more quotations from
Cuana's book occur.</p>

<p>The following volumes, almost all of which existed prior to
the year 1100, are also alluded to in our old literature:&mdash;The
Book of Dubhdaleithe; the Yellow Book of Slane; the original
Leabhar na h-Uidhre, or "Book of the Dun Cow"; the Books
of Eochaidh O'Flanagain; a certain volume known as the
book eaten by the poor people in the desert; the Book of Inis
an Dúin; the short Book of Monasterboice; the Books of
Flann of Monasterboice; the Book of Flann of Dungiven;
the Book of Downpatrick; the Book of Derry; the Book of
Sábhal Patrick; the Black Book of St. Molaga; the Yellow
Book of St. Molling; the Yellow Book of Mac Murrough;
the Book of Armagh (not the one now so called); the Red
Book of Mac Egan; the Long Book of Leithlin; the Books
of O'Scoba of Clonmacnois; the "Duil" of Drom Ceat; the
Book of Clonsost; the Book of Cluain Eidhneach (the ivy
meadow) in Leix; and one of the most valuable and often
quoted of all, Cormac's great Saltair of Cashel, compiled by
Cormac mac Culinan, who was at once king of Munster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
and archbishop of Cashel,<a name="FNanchor_4_403" id="FNanchor_4_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_403" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and who fell in battle in 903,
according to the chronology of the "Four Masters." The
above are certainly only a few of the books in which a large
early literature was contained, one that has now perished
almost to a page. Michael O'Clery, in the Preface to his
Book of Invasions written in 1631, mentions the books
from which he and his four antiquarian friends compiled their
work&mdash;mostly now perished!&mdash;and adds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The histories and synchronisms of Erin were written and tested
in the presence of those illustrious saints, as is manifest in the great
books that are named after the saints themselves and from their
great churches; for there was not an illustrious church in Erin that
had not a great book of history named from it or from the saints who
sanctified it. It would be easy, too, to know from the books which
the saints wrote, and the songs of praise which they composed in
Irish that they themselves and their churches were the centres of
the true knowledge, and the archives and homes of the manuscripts
of the authors of Erin in the elder times. But, alas! short was the
time until dispersion and decay overtook the churches of the saints,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
their relics, and their books; for there is not to be found of them
now [1631] but a small remnant that has not been carried away into
distant countries and foreign nations&mdash;carried away so that their
fate is unknown from that time unto this."</p></blockquote>

<p>As far as actual existing documents go, we have no specimens
of Irish MSS. written in Irish before the eighth century.
The chief remains of the old language that we have are mostly
found on the Continent, whither the Irish carried their books
in great numbers, and unfortunately they are not books of
saga, but chiefly, with the exception of a few poems, glosses
and explanations of books used evidently in the Irish ecclesiastical
schools.<a name="FNanchor_5_404" id="FNanchor_5_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_404" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A list of the most remarkable is worth giving
here, as it will help to show the extraordinary geographical
diversity of the Irish settlements upon the Continent, and the
keenness with which their relics have been studied by European
scholars&mdash;French, German, and Italian. The most important
are the glosses found in the Irish MSS. of Milan, published
by Ascoli, Zeuss, Stokes, and Nigra; those in St. Gall&mdash;a
monastery in Switzerland founded by St. Gall, an Irish friend
of Columbanus, in the sixth century&mdash;published by Ascoli and
Nigra; those in Wurtzburg, published by Zimmer and Zeuss;
those in Carlsruhe, published by Zeuss; those in Turin,
published by Zimmer, Nigra, and Stokes in his "Goidelica";
those in Vienna, published by Zimmer in his "Glossæ Hibernicæ"
and Stokes in his "Goidelica"; those in Berne, those in Leyden,
those in Nancy, and the glosses on the Cambrai Sermon,
published by Zeuss.<a name="FNanchor_6_405" id="FNanchor_6_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_405" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Next in antiquity to these are the Irish
parts of the Book of Armagh, the poems in the MSS. of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Gall and Milan,<a name="FNanchor_7_406" id="FNanchor_7_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_406" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and some of the pieces published by Windisch
in his "Irische Texte." Next to this is probably the
Martyrology of Angus the Culdee. And then come the
great Middle-Irish books&mdash;the Leabhar na h-Uidhre, the Book
of Leinster, and the rest.</p>

<p>From a palæographic point of view the oldest books in
Ireland are probably the "Domhnach Airgid," a copy of the
Four Gospels in a triple shrine of yew, silver-plated copper,
and gold-plated silver, which St. Patrick was believed to have
given to St. Carthainn when he told that saint with a shrewd
wisdom, which in later days aroused the admiration of Mr.
Matthew Arnold, to build himself a church "that should not
be too near to himself for familiarity nor too far from himself
for intercourse." It probably dates from the fifth or sixth
century. The Cathach supposed to have been surreptitiously
written by Columcille from Finnian's book<a name="FNanchor_8_407" id="FNanchor_8_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_407" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;a Latin copy of
the Gospels in Trinity College, Dublin; the Book of Durrow,
a beautiful illuminated copy of the same; the Book of Dimma,
containing the Four Gospels, ritual, and prayers, probably
a work of the seventh century; the Book of Molling, of
probably about the same date; the Gospels of Mac Regol,
the largest of the Old Irish Gospel books, highly but not
elegantly coloured, with an interlinear Anglo-Saxon version
in a late hand carried through its pages; the Book of Kells,
the unapproachable glory of Irish illumination, and some other
ecclesiastical books. After them come the Leabhar na
h-Uidre and the great books of poems and saga.</p>

<p>Although the language of these sagas and poems is not that
of the glosses, but what is called "Middle-Irish," still it does
not in the least follow that the poems and sagas belong to the
Middle-Irish period. "The old Middle-Irish manuscripts,"
says Zimmer, "contain for the most part only Old Irish texts
re-written."<a name="FNanchor_9_408" id="FNanchor_9_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_408" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "Unfortunately," says Windisch, "every new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
copyist has given to the text more or less of the linguistic garb
of his own day, so that as far as the language of Irish texts goes,
it depends principally upon the age of the manuscript that contains
them."<a name="FNanchor_10_409" id="FNanchor_10_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_409" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And again, in his preface to Adamnan's vision, he
writes: "Since we know that Irish texts were rewritten by
every fresh copyist more or less regularly in the speech of his
own day, the real age or a prose text cannot possibly be
determined by the linguistic forms of its language."<a name="FNanchor_11_410" id="FNanchor_11_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_410" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It is
much easier to tell the age of poetry than prose, for the
gradual modification of language, altering of words, shortening
of inflexions, and so on, must interfere with the metre, so that
when we find a poem in a twelfth-century manuscript written
in Middle Irish and in a perfect metrical form, we may&mdash;no
matter to what age it is <i>ascribed</i>&mdash;be pretty sure that it cannot
be more than two or three centuries older than the manuscript
that contains it. Yet even of the poems Dr. Atkinson
writes: "The poem <i>may</i> be of the eighth century, but the
forms are in the main of the twelfth."<a name="FNanchor_12_411" id="FNanchor_12_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_411" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Where poems that
really are of ancient date have had their language modified
in transcription so as to render them intelligible, the metre is
bound to suffer, and this lends us a criterion whereby to gauge
the age of verse, which is lacking to us when we come to deal
with prose.</p>

<p>This modification of language is not uncommon in literature
and takes place naturally, but I doubt if there ever was a
literature in which it played the same important part as in
Irish. Thus let us take the story of the Táin Bo Chuailgne,
of which I shall have more to say later on. Zimmer, after
long and careful study of the text as preserved to us in a manuscript
of about the year 1100, came to the conclusion from the
marks of Old Irish inflexion, and so forth, which still remain in
the eleventh-century text, that there had been two recensions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the story, a pre-Danish, that is, say, a seventh-century one,
and a post-Danish, that is a tenth-or eleventh-century one.
Thus the epic may have been originally committed to paper in
the seventh century, modified in the tenth, transcribed into
the manuscripts in which we have it in the eleventh and twelfth,
and propagated from that down to the eighteenth century, in
copies every one of which underwent more or less alteration
in order to render it more intelligible; and it was in fact in
an eighteenth-century manuscript, yet one that differed, as I
subsequently discovered, in few essentials from the copy in the
Book of Leinster that I first read it. As the bards lived to
please so they had to please to live. The popular mind only
receives with pleasure and transmits with readiness popular
poetry upon the condition that it is intelligible,<a name="FNanchor_13_412" id="FNanchor_13_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_412" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and hence
granting that Finn mac Cool was a real historical personage, it
is perfectly possible that some of his poetry was handed down
from generation to generation amongst the conservative Gael,
and slightly altered or modified from time to time to make it
more intelligible, according as words died out and inflexions became
obsolete. The Oriental philologist, Max Müller, in
attempting to explain how myths arose (according to his theory)
from a disease of language, thinks that during the transition
period of which he speaks, there would be many words "understood
perhaps by the grandfather, familiar to the father, but
strange to the son, and misunderstood by the grandson." This
is exactly what is taking place over half Ireland at this very
moment, and it is what has always been at work amongst a
people whose language and literature go back with certainty for
nearly 1,500 years. Accordingly before the art of writing
became common, ere yet expensive vellum MSS. and a highly-paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
class of historians and schools of scribes to a certain extent
stereotyped what they set down, it is altogether probable that
people who trusted to the ear and to memory, modified and
corrupted but still handed down, at least some famous poems,
like those ascribed to Amergin or Finn mac Cool. That the
Celtic memory for things unwritten is long I have often
proved. I have heard from peasants stanzas composed by
Donogha Mór O'Daly, of Boyle, in the thirteenth century;
I have recovered from an illiterate peasant, in 1890 in
Roscommon, verses which had been jotted down in phonetic
spelling in Argyleshire by Macgregor, Dean of Lismore, in
the year 1512, and which may have been sung for hundreds
of years before it struck the fancy of the Highland divine to
commit them to paper;<a name="FNanchor_14_413" id="FNanchor_14_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_413" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and I have again heard verses in
which the measure and sense were preserved, but found on
comparing them with MSS. that several obsolete words had
been altered to others that rhymed with them and were
intelligible.<a name="FNanchor_15_414" id="FNanchor_15_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_414" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> For these reasons I should, in many cases,
refuse absolutely to reject the authenticity of a poem
simply because the language is more modern than that of
the bard could have been to whom it is ascribed, and it
seems to me equally uncritical either to accept or reject
much of our earliest poetry, except what is in highly-developed
metre, as a good deal of it may possibly be the
actual (but linguistically modified) work of the supposed
authors.</p>

<p>This modifying process is something akin to but very
different in degree from Pope's rewriting of Donne's satires
or Dryden's version of Chaucer, inasmuch as it was probably
both unconscious and unintentional. To understand better
how this modification may have taken place, let us examine a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
few lines of the thirteenth-century English poem, the "Brut"
of Layamon:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And swa ich habbe al niht</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of mine swevene swithe ithoht,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For ich what to iwisse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Agan is al my blisse."</span><br />
</p>

<p>These lines were, no doubt, intelligible to an ordinary Englishman
at the time. Gradually they become a little modernised,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And so I have all night</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of min-e sweeven swith ythought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I wat to ywiss</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Agone is all my bliss."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Had these verses been preserved in folk-memory they must
have undergone a still further modification as soon as the words
sweeven (dream), swith (much), and ywiss (certainty) began
to grow obsolete, and we should have the verse modified and
mangled, perhaps something in this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And so I have all the night</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of my dream greatly thought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I wot and I wis</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That gone is all my bliss."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The words "I wot and I wis," in the third line, represent
just about as much archaism as the popular memory and taste
will stand without rebelling. Some modification in the direction
here hinted at may be found in, I should think, more than
half the manuscripts in the Royal Irish Academy to-day, and
just in the same sense as the lines,</p>

<p>Of the many <i>poems</i>&mdash;as distinguished from sagas, which are
a mixture of poetry and prose&mdash;said to have been produced
from pagan times down to the eighth century, none can be
properly called epics or even épopées. There are few continued
efforts, and the majority of the pieces though interesting for
a great many reasons to students, would hardly interest an
English reader when translated. Unfortunately, such a great
amount of our early literature being lost, we can only judge of
what it was like through the shorter pieces which have been
preserved, and even these short pieces read rather jejune and
barren in English, partly because of the great condensation of
the original, a condensation which was largely brought about
by the necessity of versification in difficult metres. In order
to see beauty in the most ancient Irish verse it is absolutely
necessary to read it in the original so as to perceive and appreciate
the alliteration and other <i>tours de force</i> which appear in every
line. These verses, for instance, which Mève, daughter or
Conan, is said to have pronounced over Cuchorb, her husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
in the first century, appear bald enough in a literal
translation:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Moghcorb's son whom fame conceals [covers]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well sheds he blood by his spears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A stone over his grave&mdash;'tis a pity&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who carried battle over Cliú Máil.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My noble king, he spoke not falsehood,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As black as a raven was his brow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As sharp was his spear as a razor," etc.</span><br />
</p>

<p>One might read this kind of thing for ever in a translation
without being struck by anything more than some occasional
<i>curiosa felicitas</i> of phrase or picturesque expression, and one
would never suspect that the original was so polished and complicated
as it really is. Here are these two verses done into
the exact versification of the original, in which interlinear
vowel-rhymes, alliterations, and all the other requirements of
the Irish are preserved and marked:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Mochorb's son of Fiercest FAME,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">KNown his NAME for bloody toil,</span><br />

</p>

<p>This specimen of Irish metre may help to place much of our
poetry in another light, for its beauty depends less upon the
intrinsic substance of the thought than the external elegance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
of the framework. We must understand this in order to do
justice to our versified literature, for the student must not
imagine that he will find long-sustained epics or interesting
narrative poems after the manner of the Iliad or Odyssey,
or even the Nibelungenlied, or the "Song of Roland;" none
such now exist: if they did exist they are lost. The early poems
consist rather of eulogies, elegies, historical pieces, and lyrics,
few of them of any great length, and still fewer capable of
interesting an English reader in a translation. Occasionally we
meet with touches of nature poetry of which the Gael has
always been supremely fond. Here is a tentative translation
made by O'Donovan of a part of the first poem which Finn
mac Cúmhail is said to have composed after his eating of
the salmon of knowledge:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"May-Day, delightful time! How beautiful the colour; the
blackbirds sing their full lay; would that Laighaig were here! The
cuckoos sing in constant strains. How welcome is ever the noble
brilliance of the seasons! On the margin of the branching woods
the summer swallows skim the stream. The swift horses seek the
pool. The heath spreads out its long hair, the weak, fair bog-down
grows. Sudden consternation attacks the signs, the planets, in their
courses running, exert an influence; the sea is lulled to rest, flowers
cover the earth."</p></blockquote>

<p>The language of this poem is so old as to be in parts unintelligible,
and the broken metre points to the difficulties of
transmission over a long period of time, yet he would be a bold
man who would ascribe with certainty the authorship of it to
Finn mac Cúmhail in the third century, or the elegy on Cuchorb
to Mève, daughter of Conan, a contemporary of Virgil and
Horace. And yet all the history of these people is known
and recorded with much apparent plausibility and many
collateral circumstances connecting them with the men of
their time. How much of this is genuine historical tradition?
How much is later invention? It is difficult to decide at
present.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h5>

<h4>EARLY SAGA AND ROMANCE</h4>


<p>During the golden period of the Greek and Roman genius
no one ever wrote a romance. Epics they left behind
them, and history, but the romance, the Danish saga, the
Irish <i>sgeul</i> or <i>úrsgeul</i> was unknown. It was in time of
decadence that a body of Greek prose romance appeared,
and with the exception of Petronius' semi-prose "Satyricon,"
and Apuleius' "Golden Ass," the Latin language produced
in this line little of a higher character than such works
as the Gesta Romanorum. In Greece and Italy where the
genial climate favoured all kinds of open-air representations,
the great development of the drama took the place of novelistic
literature, as it did for a long time amongst the English after
the Elizabethan revival. In Ireland, on the other hand, the
dramatic stage was never reached at all, but the development
of the <i>úrsgeul</i>, romance, or novel, was quite abnormally great.
I have seen it more than once asserted, if I mistake not, that
the dramatic is an inevitable and an early development in the
history of every literature, but this is to generalise from insufficient
instances. The Irish literature which kept on developing&mdash;to
some extent at least&mdash;for over a thousand years, and of
which hundreds of volumes still exist, never evolved a drama, nor
so much, as far as I know, as even a miracle play, although
these are found in Welsh and even Cornish. What Ireland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
did produce, and produce nobly and well, was romance; from
the first to the last, from the seventh to the seventeenth
century, Irishmen, without distinction of class, alike delighted
in the <i>úrsgeul</i>.</p>

<p>When this form of literature first came into vogue we have no
means of ascertaining, but the narrative prose probably developed
at a very early period as a supplement to defective narrative
verse. Not that verse or prose were then and there committed
to writing, for it is said that the business of the bards was to
learn their stories by heart. I take it, however, that they did
not actually do this, but merely learned the incidents of a story
in their regular sequence, and that their training enabled them
to fill these up and clothe them on the spur of the moment in
the most effective garments, decking them out with passages
of gaudy description, with rattling alliterative lines and "runs"
and abundance of adjectival declamation. The bards, no
matter from what quarter of the island, had all to know the
same story or novel, provided it was a renowned one, but with
each the sequence of incidents, and the incidents themselves
were probably for a long time the same; but the language in
which they were tricked out and the length to which they
were spun depended probably upon the genius or bent of each
particular bard. Of course in process of time divergences
began to arise, and hence different versions of the same story.
That, at least, is how I account for such passages as "but others
say that it was not there he was killed, but in," etc., "but some
of the books say that it was not on this wise it happened, but,"
and so on.</p>

<p>It is probable that very many novels were in existence before
the coming of St. Patrick, but highly unlikely that they were
at that time written down at full length. It was probably only
after the country had become Christianised and full of schools
and learning that the bards experienced the desire of writing
down their sagas, with as much as they could recapture of the
ancient poetry upon, which they were built. In the Book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Leinster, a manuscript of the twelfth century, we find an
extraordinary list of no less than 187 of those romances with
THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY of which an ollamh had to be
acquainted. The ollamh was the highest dignitary amongst
the bards, and it took him from nine to twelve years' training
to learn the two hundred and fifty prime stories and the one
hundred secondary ones along with the other things which
were required of him. The prime stories&mdash;combinations of
epic and novel, prose and poetry&mdash;are divided in the manuscripts
into the following romantic catalogue:&mdash;Destructions
of fortified places, Cow spoils (<i>i.e.</i>, cattle-raiding
expeditions), Courtships or wooings, Battles, Cave-stories,
Navigations, Tragical deaths, Feasts, Sieges, Adventures,
Elopements, Slaughters, Water-eruptions, Expeditions, Progresses,
and Visions. "He is no poet," says the Book of
Leinster, "who does not synchronise and harmonise all the
stories." We possess, as I have said, the names of 187 such
stories in the Book of Leinster, and the names of many more
are given in the tenth-or eleventh-century tale of Mac
Coisè; and all the known ones, with the exception of one tale
added later on, and one which, evidently through an error in
transcription, refers to Arthur instead of Aithirne, are about
events prior to the year 650 or thereabouts. We may take it,
then, that this list was drawn up in the seventh century.</p>

<p>Now, who were the authors of these couple of hundred
romances? It is a natural question, but one which cannot be
answered. There is not a trace of their authorship remaining,
if authorship be the right word for what I suspect to have been
the gradual growth of race, tribal, and family history, and of
Celtic mythology, told and retold, and polished up, and added
to; some of them, especially such as are the descendants of a
pagan mythology, must have been handed down for perhaps
countless generations, others recounted historical, tribal, or
family doings, magnified during the course of time, others again
of more recent date, are perhaps fairly accurate accounts of actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
events, but all PRIOR TO ABOUT THE YEAR 650. I take it that
so soon as bardic schools and colleges began to be formed, there
was no class of learning more popular than that which taught
the great traditionary stories of the various tribes and families
of the great Gaelic race, and the intercommunication between
the bardic colleges propagated local tradition throughout all
Ireland.</p>

<p>The very essence of the national life of Erin was embodied
in these stories, but, unfortunately, few out of the enormous
mass have survived to our day, and these mostly mutilated or
in mere digests. Some, however, exist at nearly full length,
quite sufficient to show us what the romances were like, and
to cause us to regret the irreparable loss inflicted upon our race
by the ravages of Danes, Normans, and English. Even as it
is O'Curry asserts that the contents of the strictly historical
tales known to him would be sufficient to fill up four thousand
of the large pages of the "Four Masters." He computed that
the tales about Finn, Ossian, and the Fenians alone would fill
another three thousand pages. In addition to these we have a
considerable number of imaginative stories, neither historical nor
Fenian, such as the "Three Sorrows of Story-telling" and
the like, sufficient to fill five thousand pages more, not to speak
of the more recent novel-like productions of the later Irish.<a name="FNanchor_1_418" id="FNanchor_1_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_418" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is this very great fecundity of the very early Irish in the
production of saga and romance, in poetry and prose, which
best enables us to judge of their early-developed genius, and
considerable primitive culture. The introduction of Christianity
neither inspired these romances nor helped to produce
them; they are nearly all anterior to it, and had they been
preserved to us we should now have the most remarkable body
of primitive myth and saga in the whole western world. It is
probably this consideration which makes M. Darmesteter say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
of Irish literature: "real historical documents we have none
until the beginning of the decadence&mdash;a decadence so glorious,
that we almost mistake it for a renaissance since the old epic
sap dries up only to make place for a new budding and
bourgeoning, a growth less original certainly, but scarcely less
wonderful if we consider the condition of continental Europe
at that date." The decadence that M. Darmesteter alludes to
is the rise of the Christian schools of the fifth and sixth
centuries, which put to some extent an end to the epic period
by turning men's thoughts into a different channel.</p>

<p>It is this "decadence," however, which I have preferred to
examine first, just because it does rest upon real historical
documents, and can be proved. We may now, however,
proceed to the mass of saga, the bulk of which in its earliest
forms is pagan, and the spirit of which, even in the latest
texts, has been seldom quite distorted by Christian influence.
This saga centres around several periods and individuals: some
of these, like Tuathal and the Boru tribute, Conairé the
Great and his death, have only one or two stories pertaining to
them. But there are three cycles which stand out pre-eminently,
and have been celebrated in more stories and sagas
than the rest, and of which more remains have been preserved
to us than of any of the others. These are the Mythological
Circle concerning the Tuatha De Dannan and the Pre-Milesians;
the Heroic, Ultonian, or Red-Branch Cycle,<a name="FNanchor_2_419" id="FNanchor_2_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_419" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in
which Cuchulain is the dominating figure; and the Cycle of
Finn mac Cúmhail, Ossian, Oscar, and the High-kings of
Ireland who were their contemporaries&mdash;this cycle may be
denominated the Fenian or Ossianic.</p>

<h4>THE MYTHOLOGICAL CYCLE</h4>


<p>The cycle of the mythological stories which group themselves
round the early invasions of Erin is sparsely represented in
Irish manuscripts. Not only is their number less, but their
substance is more confused than that of the other cycles. To
the comparative mythologist and the folk-lorist, however, they
are perhaps the most interesting of all, as throwing more light
than any of the others upon the early religious ideas of the
race. Most of the sagas connected with this pre-Milesian
cycle are now to be found only in brief digests preserved
in the Leabhar Gabhála,<a name="FNanchor_1_420" id="FNanchor_1_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_420" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or Book of Invasions of Ireland, of
which large fragments exist in the Books of Leinster and
Ballymote, and which Michael O'Clery (collecting from all
the ancient sources which he could find in his day) rewrote
about the year 1630.</p>

<p>This tells us all the early history of Ireland and of the races
that inhabited it before our forefathers landed. It tells us of
how first a man called Partholan made a settlement in Ireland,
but how in time he and his people all died of the plague,
leaving the land deserted; and how after that the Nemedians,
or children of Nemed, colonised the island and multiplied in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
until they began to be oppressed by the Fomorians, who are
usually described as African sea-robbers, but the etymology of
whose name seems to point to a mythological origin "men
from under sea."<a name="FNanchor_2_421" id="FNanchor_2_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_421" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> A number of battles took place between the
rival hosts, and the Fomorians were defeated in three battles,
but after the death of Nemed, who, like Partholan, died of a
plague, the Fomorians oppressed his people again, and, led by
a chief called Conaing, built a great tower upon Tory, <i>i.e.</i>,
Tower Island, off the north-west coast of Donegal. On the
eve of every Samhain [Sou-an, or All Hallow's] the wretched
Nemedians had to deliver up to these masters two-thirds of
their children, corn, and cattle. Driven to desperation by these
exactions they rose in arms, stormed the tower, and slew
Conaing, all which the Book of Invasions describes at length.
The Fomorians being reinforced, the Nemedians fought
them a second time in the same place, but in this battle most
of them were killed or drowned, the tide having come in and
washed over them and their foes alike. The crew of one ship,
however, escaped, and these, after a further sojourn of seven
years in Ireland, led out of it the surviving remnants of their
race with the exception of a very few who remained behind
subject to the Fomorians. Those who left Ireland divided
into three bands: one sought refuge in Greece, where they
again fell into slavery; the second went&mdash;some say&mdash;to the
north of Europe; and the third, headed by a chief called
Briton Mael&mdash;Hence, say the Irish, the name of Great Britain&mdash;found
refuge in Scotland, where their descendants remained
until the Cruithni, or Picts, overcame them.</p>

<p>After a couple of hundred years the Nemedians who had
fled to Greece came back again, calling themselves Firbolg,<a name="FNanchor_3_422" id="FNanchor_3_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_422" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
<i>i.e.</i>, "sack" or "bag" men, and held Ireland for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
about thirty-five years in peace, when another tribe of invaders
appeared upon the scene. These were no less than the celebrated
Tuatha De Danann, who turned out to be, in fact,
the descendants of the second band of Nemedians who had
fled to the north of Europe, and who returned about thirty-six
years later than their kinsmen, the Firbolg.</p>

<p>The Tuatha De Danann soon overcame the Firbolg, and
drove them, after the Battle of North Moytura,<a name="FNanchor_4_423" id="FNanchor_4_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_423" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> into the
islands along the coast, to Aran, Islay, Rachlin, and the
Hebrides,<a name="FNanchor_5_424" id="FNanchor_5_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_424" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> after which they assumed the sovereignty of the
island to themselves.</p>

<p>This sovereignty they maintained for about two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
years, until the ancestors of the present Irish, the Scots, or Gaels,
or Milesians, as they are variously called, landed and beat the
Tuatha De Danann, and reigned in their stead until they, too,
in their turn were conquered by the English. The Book of
Conquests is largely concerned with their landing and first
settlements and their battles with the De Danann people
whom they ended in completely overcoming, after which the
Tuatha Dé assume a very obscure position. They appear to
have for the most part retired off the surface of the country
into the green hills and mounds, and lived in these, often
appearing amongst the Milesian population, and sometimes
giving their daughters in marriage to them. From this out
they are confounded with the <i>Sidhe</i> [Shee], or spirits, now called
fairies, and to this very day I have heard old men, when
speaking of the fairies who inhabit ancient raths and interfere
occasionally in mortal concerns either for good or evil, call
them by the name of the Tuatha De Danann.</p>

<p>The first battle of Moytura was fought between the Tuatha
De Danann and the Firbolg, who were utterly routed, but
Nuada, the king of the Tuatha Dé, lost his hand in the
battle. As he was thus suffering from a personal blemish, he
could be no longer king, and the people accordingly decided
to bestow the sovereignty on Breas [Bras],<a name="FNanchor_6_425" id="FNanchor_6_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_425" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> whose mother was
a De Danann, but whose father was a king of the Fomorians,
a people who had apparently never lost sight of or wholly left
Ireland since the time of their battles with the Nemedians
over two hundred years before. The mother of Breas, Eiriu,<a name="FNanchor_7_426" id="FNanchor_7_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_426" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
was a person of authority, and her son was elected to the
sovereignty on the understanding that if his reign was found
unsatisfactory he should resign. He gave seven pledges of his
intention of doing so. At this time the Fomorians again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
smote Ireland heavily with their imposts and taxes, as they had
done before when the Nemedians inhabited it. The unfortunate
De Dannan people were reduced to a state of misery.
Ogma<a name="FNanchor_8_427" id="FNanchor_8_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_427" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was obliged to carry wood, and the Dagda himself to
build raths for their masters, and they were so far reduced as
to be weak with hunger.</p>

<p>In the meantime the kingship of Breas was not successful.
He was hard and niggardly. As the saga of the second battle
of Moytura puts it&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The chiefs of the Tuatha De Danann were dissatisfied, for Breas
did not grease their knives; in vain came they to visit Breas; their
breaths did not smell of ale. Neither their poets, nor bards, nor
druids, nor harpers, nor flute-players, nor musicians, nor jugglers,
nor fools appeared before them, nor came into the palace to amuse
them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Matters reached a crisis when the poet Coirpné came to
demand hospitality and was shown "into a little house, small,
narrow, black, dark, where was neither fire nor furniture nor
bed. He was given three little dry loaves on a little plate.
When he rose in the morning he was not thankful." He
gave vent then to the first satire ever uttered in Ireland, which
is still preserved in eight lines which would be absolutely
unintelligible except for the ancient glosses.</p>

<p>After this the people of the De Danann race demanded the
abdication of Breas, which he had promised in case his reign did
not please them. He acknowledged his obligation to them, but
requested a delay of seven years, which they allowed him, on
condition that he gave them guarantees to touch nothing
belonging to them during that time, "neither our houses nor
our lands, nor our gold, nor our silver, nor our cattle, nor
anything eatable, we shall pay thee neither rent nor fine to the
end of seven years." This was agreed to.</p>

<p>But the intention of Breas in demanding a delay of seven
years was a treacherous one; he meant to approach his father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
kindred the Fomorians, and move them to reinstate him at the
point of the sword. He goes to his mother who tells him
who his father is, for up to that time he had remained in
ignorance of it; and she gives him a ring whereby his father
Elatha, a king of the Fomorians, may recognise him. He
departs to the Fomorians, discovers his father and appeals to
him for succour. By his father he is sent to Balor, a king of
the Fomorians of the Isles of Norway&mdash;a locality probably
ascribed to the Fomorians after the invasions of the Northmen&mdash;and
there gathered together an immense army to subdue
the Tuatha De Danann and give the island to their relation
Breas.</p>

<p>In the meantime Nuada, whose hand had been replaced by
a silver one, reascends the throne and is joined by Lugh of the
Long-hand, the "Ildana" or "man of various arts." This Lugh
was a brother of the Dagda and of Ogma, and is perhaps the
best-known figure among the De Danann personalities. Lugh
and the Dagda and Ogma and Goibniu the smith and Diancécht
the leech met secretly every day at a place in Meath for
a whole year, and deliberated how best to shake off the yoke
of the Fomorians. Then they held a general meeting of the
Tuatha De and spoke with each one in secret.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'How wilt thou show thy power?' said Lugh, to the sorcerer
Mathgen.</p>

<p>"'By my art,' answered Mathgen, 'I shall throw down the mountains
of Ireland upon the Fomorians, and they shall fall with their
heads to the earth;' then told he to Lugh the names of the twelve
principal mountains of Ireland which were ready to do the bidding
of the goddess Dana<a name="FNanchor_9_428" id="FNanchor_9_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_428" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and to smite their enemies on every side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lugh asked the cup-bearer: 'In what way wilt thou show thy
power?'</p>

<p>"'I shall place,' answered the cup-bearer, 'the twelve principal
lakes of Ireland under the eyes of the Fomorians, but they shall find
no water in them, however great the thirst which they may feel;'
and he enumerated the lakes, 'from the Fomorians the water shall
hide itself, they shall not be able to take a drop of it; but the same
lakes will furnish the Tuatha De Danann with water to drink during
the whole war, though it should last seven years.'</p>

<p>"The Druid Figal, the son of Mamos, said, 'I shall make three
rains of fire fall on the faces of the Fomorian warriors; I shall take
from them two-thirds of their valour and courage, but so often as
the warriors of the De Danann shall breathe out the air from their
breasts, so often shall they feel their courage and valour and strength
increase. Even though the war should last seven years it shall not
fatigue them.'</p>

<p>"The Dagda answered, 'All the feats which you three, sorcerer,
cup-bearer, druid, say you can do, I myself alone shall do them.'</p>

<p>"'It is you then are the Dagda,'<a name="FNanchor_10_429" id="FNanchor_10_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_429" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> said those present, whence came
the name of the Dagda which he afterwards bore."</p></blockquote>

<p>Lugh then went in search of the three gods of Dana&mdash;Brian,
Iuchar, and Iucharba (whom he afterwards put to
death for slaying his father, as is recorded at length in the
saga of the "Fate of the Children of Tuireann"<a name="FNanchor_11_430" id="FNanchor_11_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_430" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>) and
with these and his other allies he spent the next seven years
in making preparations for the great struggle with the
Fomorians.</p>

<p>This saga and the whole story of the Tuatha De Danann
contending with the Fomorians, who are in one place in the
saga actually called <i>sidhe</i>, or spirits, is all obviously mythological,
and has usually been explained, by D'Arbois de Jubainville
and others, as the struggle between the gods or good
spirits and the evil deities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>The following episode also shows the wild mythological
character of the whole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dagda," says the saga, "had a habitation at Glenn-Etin in the north.
He had arranged to meet a woman at Glenn-Etin on the day of
Samhan [November day] just a year, day for day, before the battle
of Moytura. The Unius, a river of Connacht, flows close beside
Glenn-Etin, to the south. Dagda saw the woman bathe herself in the
Unius at [Kesh] Coran. One of the woman's feet in the water
touched Allod Eche, that is to say Echumech to the south, the
other foot also in the water touched Lescuin in the north. Nine
tresses floated loose around her head. Dagda approached and
accosted her. From thenceforth the place has been named the
Couple's Bed. The woman was the goddess Mór-rígu"&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>the goddess of war, of whom we shall hear more in connection
with Cuchulain.</p>

<p>As for the Dagda himself, his character appears somewhat
contradictory. Just as the most opposite accounts of Zeus are
met with in Greek mythology, some glorifying him as throning
in Olympus supreme over gods and men, others as playing
low and indecent tricks disguised as a cuckoo or a bull; so we
find the Dagda&mdash;his real name was Eochaidh the Ollamh&mdash;at
one time a king of the De Danann race and organiser
of victory, but at another in a less dignified but more clearly
mythological position. He is sent by Lugh to the Fomorian
camp to put them off with talk and cause them to lose time
until the De Danann armaments should be more fully ready.
The following account exhibits him, like Zeus at times, in a
very unprepossessing character:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When the Dagda had come to the camp of the Fomorians he
demanded a truce, and he obtained it. The Fomorians prepared
a porridge for him; it was to ridicule him they did this, for he
greatly loved porridge. They filled for him the king's cauldron
which was five handbreadths in depth. They threw into it eighty
pots of milk and a proportionate quantity of meal and fat, with goats
and sheep and swine which they got cooked along with the rest.
Then they poured the broth into a hole dug in the ground. 'Unless
you eat all that's there,' said Indech to him, 'you shall be put to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
death; we do not want you to be reproaching us, and we must
satisfy you.' The Dagda took the spoon; it was so great that in the
hollow of it a man and a woman might be contained. The pieces
that went into that spoon were halves of salted pigs and quarters of
bacon. The Dagda said, 'Here is good eating, if the broth be as
good as its odour,' and as he carried the spoonful to his mouth, he
said, 'The proverb is true that good cooking is not spoiled by a
bad pot.'<a name="FNanchor_12_431" id="FNanchor_12_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_431" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>"When he had finished he scraped the ground with his finger to
the very bottom of the hole to take what remained of it, and after
that he went to sleep to digest his soup. His stomach was greater
than the greatest cauldrons in large houses, and the Fomorians
mocked at him.</p>

<p>"He went away and came to the bank of the Eba. He did not
walk with ease, so large was his stomach. He was dressed in very
bad guise. He had a cape which scarcely reached below his
shoulders. Beneath that cloak was seen a brown mantle which
descended no lower than his hips. It was cut away above and very
large in the breast. His two shoes were of horses' skin with the
hair outside. He held a wheeled fork, which would have been
heavy enough for eight men, and he let it trail behind him. It dug
a furrow deep enough and large enough to become the frontier
mearn between two provinces. Therefore is it called the 'track of
the Dagda's club.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>When the fighting began, after the skirmishing of the first
days, the De Danann warriors owed their victory to their
superior preparations. The great leech Diancecht cured the
wounded, and the smith Goibniu and his assistants kept the
warriors supplied with constant relays of fresh lances. The
Fomorians could not understand it, and sent one of their
warriors, apparently in disguise, to find out. He was Ruadan,
a son of Breas by a daughter of Dagda.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On his return he told the Fomorians what the smith, the carpenter,
the worker in bronze, and the four leeches who were round the
spring, did. They sent him back again with orders to kill the smith
Goibniu. He asked a spear of Goibniu, rivets of Credné the bronze-worker,
a shaft of Luchtainé the carpenter, and they gave him
what he asked. There was a woman there busy in sharpening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
weapons. She was Cron, mother of Fianlug. She sharpened the
spear for Ruadan. It was a chief who handed Ruadan the spear,
and thence the name of chief-spear given to this day to the
weaver's beam in Erin.</p>

<p>"When he had got the spear Ruadan turned on Goibniu and smote
him with the weapon. But Goibniu drew the javelin from the
wound and hurled it at Ruadan; who was pierced from side to side,
and escaped to die among the Fomorians in presence of his father.
Brig [his mother, the Dagda's daughter] came and bewailed her
son. First she uttered a piercing cry, and thereafter she made
moan. It was then that for the first time in Ireland were heard
moans and cries of sorrow. It was that same Brig who invented
the whistle used at night to give alarm signals"&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>the mythological genesis of the saga is thus obviously marked
by the first satire, first cry of sorrow, and first whistle being
ascribed to the actors in it.</p>

<p>In the end the whole Fomorian army moved to battle in
their solid battalions, "and it was to strike one's hand against
a rock, or thrust one's hand into a nest of serpents, or put
one's head into the fire, to attack the Fomorians that day."
The battle is described at length. Nuada the king of the De
Danann is killed by Balor. Lugh, whose counsel was considered
so valuable by the De Danann people that they put an
escort of nine round him to prevent him from taking part in
the fighting, breaks away, and attacks Balor the Fomorian
king.</p>

<p>"Balor had an evil eye, that eye only opened itself upon the
plain of battle. Four men had to lift up the eyelid by placing
under it an instrument. The warriors, whom Balor scanned
with that eye once opened,<a name="FNanchor_13_432" id="FNanchor_13_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_432" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> could not&mdash;no matter how numerous&mdash;resist
their enemies."</p>

<p>When Lugh had met and exchanged some mystical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
unintelligible language with him, Balor said, "Raise my
eyelid that I may see the braggart who speaks with me."</p>

<p>"His people raise Balor's eyelid. Lugh from his sling lets
fly a stone at Balor which passes through his head, carrying
with it the venomous eye. Balor's army looked on." The
Mór-rígu, the goddess of war, arrives, and assists the Tuatha De
Danann and encourages them. Ogma slays one of the
Fomorian kings and is slain himself. The battle is broken
at last on the Fomorians; they fly, and Breas is taken
prisoner, but his life is spared.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was," says the saga, "at the battle of Moytura that Ogma,
the strong man, found the sword of Tethra, the King of the
Fomorians. Ogma drew that sword from the sheath and cleaned
it. It was then that it related to him all the high deeds that it had
accomplished, for at this time the custom was when swords were
drawn from the sheath they used to recite the exploits<a name="FNanchor_14_433" id="FNanchor_14_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_433" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> they had
themselves been the cause of. And thence comes the right which
swords have, to be cleaned when they are drawn from the sheath;
thence also the magic power which swords have preserved ever
since"&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>to which curious piece of pagan superstition an evidently
later Christian redactor adds, "weapons were the organs of
the demon to speak to men. At that time men used to
worship weapons, and they were a magic safeguard."</p>

<p>The saga ends in the episode of the recovery of the Dagda's
harp, and in the cry of triumph uttered by the Mór-rígu and
by Bodb, her fellow-goddess of war, as they visited the various
heights of Ireland, the banks of streams, and the mouths of
floods and great rivers, to proclaim aloud their triumph and
the defeat of the Fomorians.</p>

<p>M. d'Arbois de Jubainville sees in the successive colonisations
of Partholan, the Nemedians, and the Tuatha De Danann, an
Irish version of the Greek legend of the three successive ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
of gold, silver, and brass. The Greek legend of the Chimæra,
otherwise Bellerus, the monster slain by Bellerophon, he
equates with the Irish Balor of the evil eye; the fire from the
throat of Bellerus, and the evil beam shot from Balor's eye may
originally have typified the lightning.<a name="FNanchor_15_434" id="FNanchor_15_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_434" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

the seventh century, only one battle of Moytura was mentioned; this was
evidently what is now known as the second battle. In the more recent list
contained in the introduction to the Senchus Mór there is mention made of
both battles. There is only a single copy of each of these sagas known to
exist. Of most of the other sagas of this cycle even the last copy has
perished.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_424" id="Footnote_5_424"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_424"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Long afterwards, at the time that Ireland was divided into five provinces,
the Cruithnigh, or Picts, drove the Firbolg out of the islands again,
and they were forced to come back to Cairbré Niafer, king of Leinster,
who allotted them a territory, but placed such a rack-rent upon them that
they were glad to fly into Connacht, where Oilioll and Mève&mdash;the king
and queen who made the Táin Bo Chuailgne&mdash;gave them a free grant of
land, and there Duald Mac Firbis, over two hundred and fifty years ago,
found their descendants in plenty. According to some accounts, they were
never driven wholly out of Connacht, and if they are a real race&mdash;as,
despite their connection with the obviously mythical Tuatha De Danann,
they appear to be&mdash;they probably still form the basis of population there.
Máine Mór, the ancestor of the O'Kellys, is said to have wrested from them
the territory of Ui Máiné (part of Roscommon and Galway) in the sixth
century. Their name and that of their fellow tribe, the Fir Domnan,
<i>appear</i> to be the same as the Belgæ, and the Damnonii of Gaul and
Britain, who are said to have given its name to Devonshire. Despite their
close connection in the Book of Invasions and early history of Ireland, the
Firbolg stand on a completely different footing from the De Danann
tribes. Their history is recorded consecutively from that day to this;
many families trace their pedigree to them, and they never wholly disappeared.
No family traces its connection to the De Danann people;
they wholly disappear, and are in later times regarded as gods, or demons,
or fairies.</p></div>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h5>

<h4>THE HEROIC OR RED BRANCH CYCLE&mdash;CUCHULAIN</h4>


<p>The mythological tales that we have been glancing at deal
with the folk who are fabled as having first colonised Erin;
they treat of peoples, races, dynasties, the struggle between
good and evil principles. The whole of their creations are
thrown back, even by the Irish annalists themselves, into the
dim cloud-land of an unplumbed past, ages before the dawn
of the first Olympiad, or the birth of the wolf-suckled twins
who founded Rome. There is over it all a shadowy sense of
vagueness, vastness, uncertainty.</p>

<p>The Heroic Cycle, on the other hand, deals with the history
of the Milesians themselves, the present Irish race, within a
well-defined space of time, upon their own ground, and though
it does not exactly fall within the historical period, yet it does
not come so far short of it that it can be with any certainty
rejected as pure work of imagination or poetic fiction. It is
certainly the finest of the three greater saga-cycles, and the
epics that belong to it are sharply drawn, numerous, clear cut,
and ancient, and for the first time we <i>seem</i>, at least, to find
ourselves upon historical ground, although a good deal of this
seeming may turn out to be illusory. Yet the figures of
Cuchulain, Conor mac Nessa, Naoise, and Déirdre, Mève,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Oilioll, and Conall Cearnach, have about them a great deal of
the circumstantiality that is entirely lacking to the dim, mist-magnified,
and distorted figures of the Dagda, Nuada, Lugh
the Long-handed, and their fellows.</p>

<p>The gods come and go as in the Iliad, and according to
some accounts leave their posterity behind them. Cuchulain
himself, the incarnation of Irish &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#941;&#953;&#945;, is according to
certain authorities the son of the god Lugh the Long-handed.<a name="FNanchor_1_435" id="FNanchor_1_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_435" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
He himself, like another Anchises, is beloved of a goddess and
descends into the Gaelic Elysium,<a name="FNanchor_2_436" id="FNanchor_2_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_436" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the most important
epic of the cycle is largely conditioned by an occurrence
caused by the curse of a goddess, an occurrence wholly impossible
and supernatural.<a name="FNanchor_3_437" id="FNanchor_3_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_437" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Yet these are for the most part
excrescences no more affecting the conduct of the history
than the actions of the gods affect the war round Troy.
Events, upon the whole, are motivated upon fairly reasonable
human grounds, and there is a certain air of probability
about them. The characters who now make their appearance
upon the scene are not long prior to, or are contemporaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
with, the birth of Christ; and the wars of the Tuatha De
Danann, Nemedians, and Fomorians, are left some seventeen
hundred years behind.</p>

<p>This cycle, which I have called the "Heroic" or "Red
Branch," might also be named the "Ultonian," because it
deals chiefly with the heroes of the northern province. One
saga relates the birth of Conor mac Nessa. His mother was
Ness and his father was Fachtna Fathach, king of Ulster, but
according to what is probably the oldest account, his father
was Cathba the Druid. This saga relates how, through the
stratagem of his mother Ness, Conor slipped into the kingship
of Ulster, displacing Fergus mac Róigh [Roy], the former king,
who is here represented as a good-natured giant, but who appears
human enough in the other sagas.<a name="FNanchor_4_438" id="FNanchor_4_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_438" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Conor's palace is described
with its three buildings; that of the Red Branch, where were
kept the heads and arms of vanquished enemies; that of the
Royal Branch, where the kings lodged; and that of the
Speckled House, where were laid up the shields and spears
and swords of the warriors of Ulster. It was called the
Speckled or Variegated House from the gold and silver of the
shields, and gleaming of the spears, and shining of the goblets,
and all arms were kept in it, in order that at the banquet
when quarrels arose the warriors might not have wherewith
to slay each other.</p>

<p>Conor's palace at Emania contained, according to the Book
of Leinster, one hundred and fifty rooms, each large enough
for three couples to sleep in, constructed of red oak, and
bordered with copper. Conor's own chamber was decorated
with bronze and silver, and ornamented with golden birds, in
whose eyes were precious stones, and was large enough for thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
warriors to drink together in it. Above the king's head hung
his silver wand with three golden apples, and when he shook
it silence reigned throughout the palace, so that even the fall
of a pin might be heard. A large vat, always full of good
drink, stood ever on the palace floor.</p>

<p>Another story tells of Cuchulain's mysterious parentage.
His mother was a sister of King Conor; consequently he was
the king's nephew.</p>

<p>Another again relates the wooing of Cuchulain, and how
he won Emer for his wife.</p>

<p>Another is called Cuchulain's "Up-bringing," or teaching, part
of which, however, is found in the piece called the "Wooing
of Emer." This saga relates how he, with two other of the
Ultonians, went abroad to Alba to perfect their warlike
accomplishments, and how they placed themselves under the
tuition of different female-warriors,<a name="FNanchor_5_439" id="FNanchor_5_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_439" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who taught them various
and extraordinary feats of arms. He traverses the plain of
Misfortune by the aid of a wheel and of an apple given him
by an unknown friend, and reaches the great female instructress
Scathach, whose daughter falls in love with him.</p>

<p>An admirable example occurs to me here, of showing in the
concrete that which I have elsewhere laid stress upon, namely,
the great elaboration which in many instances we find in the
modern versions of sagas, compared with the antique vellum
texts. It does not at all follow that because a story is written
down with brevity in ancient Irish, it was also told with
brevity. The oldest form of the saga of Cuchulain's "Wooing
of Emer" contains traces of a pre-Danish or seventh-century
text, but the condensed and shortened relation of the saga
found in the oldest manuscript of it, is almost certainly not
the form in which the bards and ollavs related it. On the
contrary, I believe that the stories now epitomised in ancient
vellum texts were even then told, though not written down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
at full length, and with many flourishes by the bards and
professed story-tellers, and that the skeletons merely, or as
Keating calls it, the "bones of the history,"<a name="FNanchor_6_440" id="FNanchor_6_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_440" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> were in most
instances all that was committed to the rare and expensive
parchments. It is more than likely that the longer modern
paper redactions, though some of the ancient pagan traits,
especially those most incomprehensible to the moderns, may
be missing, yet represent more nearly the <i>manner</i> of the
original bardic telling, than the abridgments of twelfth or
thirteenth-century vellums.</p>

<p>In this case the ancient recension,<a name="FNanchor_7_441" id="FNanchor_7_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_441" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> founded on a pre-Danish
text, merely mentions that Scathach's house, at which Cuchulain
arrives, after leaving the plain of Misfortune,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"was built upon a rock of appalling height. Cuchulain followed
the road pointed out to him. He reached the castle of Scathach.
He knocked at the door with the handle of his spear and entered.
Uathach, the daughter of Scathach, meets him. She looked at him,
but she spoke not, so much did the hero's beauty make her love
him. She went to her mother and told her of the beauty of the man
who had newly come. 'That man has pleased you,' said her mother.
'He shall come to my couch,' answered the girl, 'and I shall sleep
at his side this night.' 'Thy intention displeases me not,' said her
mother."</p></blockquote>

<p>One can see at a glance how bald and brief is all this, because
it is a précis, and vellum was scarce. I venture to say that no
bard ever told it in this way. The scribes who first committed
this to parchment, say in the seventh or eighth century, probably
wrote down only the leading incidents as they remembered
them. They may not have been themselves either bards,
ollavs, or story-tellers. It is chiefly in the later centuries,
after the introduction of paper, when the economising of
space ceased to be a matter of importance, that we find our
sagas told with all the redundancy of description, epithet, and
incident with which I suspect the very earliest bards embellished
all those sagas of which we have now only little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
than the skeletons. Compare, for instance, the ancient version
which I have just given, with the longer modern versions which
have come down to us in several paper manuscripts, of which I
here use one in my own possession, copied about the beginning
of the century by a scribe named O'Mahon, upon one of the
islands on the Shannon.</p>

<p>In the first place this version tells us that on his arrival at
Scathach's mansion he finds a number of her scholars and other
warriors engaged in hurling outside the door of her fortress.
He joins in the game and defeats them&mdash;this is a true folk-lore
introduction. He finds there Naoise, Ardan, and Ainnlè, the
three sons of Usnach, celebrated in perhaps the most touching
saga of this whole cycle, and another son of Erin with them.
This is a literary touch, by one who knew his literature.<a name="FNanchor_8_442" id="FNanchor_8_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_442" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Learning that he is come from Erin, they ask news of their native
country, and salute him with kisses. They then bring him to
the Bridge of the Cliffs, and show him what their work is
during the first year, which was learning to pass this bridge.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wonderful," says the saga, "was the sight that bridge afforded
when any one would leap upon it, for it narrowed until it became as
narrow as the hair of one's head, and the second time it shortened
until it became as short as an inch, and the third time it grew
slippery until it was as slippery as an eel of the river, and the
fourth time it rose up on high against you until it was as tall as the
mast of a ship."</p></blockquote>

<p>All the warriors and people on the lawn came down to see
Cuchulain attempting to cross this bridge. In the meantime
Scathach's <i>grianán</i> or sunny house is described: "It had seven
great doors, and seven great windows between every two doors
of them, and thrice fifty couches between every two windows
of them, and thrice fifty handsome marriageable girls, in scarlet
cloaks, and in beautiful and blue attire, attending and waiting
upon Scathach."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Scathach's lovely daughter, looking from the windows
of the <i>grianán</i>, perceives the stranger attempting the feat of
the bridge, and she falls in love with him upon the spot. Her
emotions are thus described: "Her face and colour constantly
changed, so that now she would be as white as a little white
flowret, and again she would become scarlet," and in the work
she was embroidering she put the gold thread where the silver
thread should be, and the silver thread into the place where
the gold thread should go; and when her mother notices it,
she excuses herself by saying beautifully, "I would greatly
grieve should he not return alive to his own people, in whatever
part of the world they may be, for I know that there
is some one to whom it would be anguish to know that he
is thus."</p>

<p>This refined reflection of the girl we may with certainty
ascribe to the growth of modern sentiment, and it is extremely
instructive to compare it with the ancient, and no doubt really
pagan version; but I strongly suspect that the bridge over the
cliffs is no modern embellishment at all, but part of the original
saga, though omitted from the pre-Norse text which only tells us
that Scathach's house was on the top of a rock of appalling
height.</p>

<p>It was during this sojourn of Cuchulain in foreign lands
that he overcame the heroine Aoife,<a name="FNanchor_9_443" id="FNanchor_9_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_443" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and forced her into a
marriage with himself. He returned home afterwards, having
left instructions with her to keep the child she should bear
him, if it were a daughter, "for with every mother goes the
daughter," but if it were a son she was to rear him until he
should be able to perform certain hero-feats, and until his
finger should be large enough to fill a ring which Cuchulain
left with her for him. Then she was to send him into
Erin, and bid him tell no man who he was; also he desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
her not to teach him the feat of the Gae-Bulg, "but,
however," says the saga, "it was ill that command turned
out, for it was of that it came to pass that Conlaoch [the son]
fell by Cuchulain."<a name="FNanchor_10_444" id="FNanchor_10_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_444" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>I know of no prose saga of the touching story of the death
of this son, slain by his own father, except the <i>résumé</i> given of
it by Keating,<a name="FNanchor_11_445" id="FNanchor_11_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_445" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> but there exists a poem or épopée upon the
subject which was always a great favourite with the Irish
scribes, and of which numerous but not ancient copies exist.
This is the Irish Sohrab and Rustum, the Celtic Hildebrand
and Hadubrand. The son comes into Ireland, but in consequence
of his mother's command, refuses to tell his name.
This is looked upon as indicating hostility, and many of the
Ultonians fight with him, but he overcomes them all, even the
great Conall Cearnach. Conor in despair sends for Cuchulain,
who with difficulty slays him by the feat of the Gae-Bolg,
and then finds out when too late that the dying champion is
his own son. So familiar to the modern Irish scribes was this
piece that in my copy, in the last verse, which ends with
Cuchulain's lament over his son&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I am the bark (buffeted) from wave to wave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the ship after the losing of its rudder,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am the apple upon the top of the tree</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That little thought of its falling."<a name="FNanchor_12_446" id="FNanchor_12_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_446" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>instead of the text of the third line stands a rough picture of a
tree with a large apple on the top!</p>

<p>Another saga<a name="FNanchor_13_447" id="FNanchor_13_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_447" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> tells of Cuchulain's <i>geasa</i> [gassa] or restrictions.
It was <i>geis</i> or tabu to him to narrate his genealogy
to one champion, as it was also to his son Conlaoch, to refuse
combat to any one man, to look upon the exposed bosom of
a woman, to come into a company without a second invitation,
to accept the hospitality of virgins, to boast to a woman,
to let the sun rise before him in Emania, he must when there
rise before it, etc. There is in this saga a graphic description
of the pagan king's retinue journeying with him to be fed in
the house of a retainer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All the Ultonian nobles set out; a great train of provincials, sons
of kings and chiefs, young lords and men-at-arms, the curled and
rosy youth of the kingdom, and the maidens and fair ringleted
ladies of Ulster. Handsome virgins, accomplished damsels, and
splendid, fully-developed women were there. Satirists and scholars
were there, and the companies of singers and musicians, poets who
composed songs and reproofs, and praising-poems for the men of
Ulster. There came also with them from Emania historians, judges,
horse-riders, buffoons, tumblers, fools, and performers on horseback.
They all went by the same way, behind the king."<a name="FNanchor_14_448" id="FNanchor_14_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_448" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Dismissing Cuchulain for the present, we pass on now to
another personality of the Red Branch saga&mdash;the Lady
Déirdre.</p>

periods, rendering them feeble as a woman in child-bed, in consequence
of the malediction of the goddess Macha, who was, just before the birth of
her children, inhumanly obliged by the Ultonians to run against the king's
horses. The only people of the northern province free from this curse
were the children born before the curse was uttered, the women, and the
hero Cuchulain. It transmitted itself from father to son for nine generations,
and is said to have lasted five nights and four days, or four nights
and five days. But one would think from the Táin Bo Chuailgne that it
must have lasted much longer. For this curse <i>see</i> Jubainville's "Epopée

<h4>DÉIRDRE</h4>


<p>One of the key-stone stories of the Red Branch Cycle is
Déirdre, or the Fate of the Children of Usnach. Cuchulain,
though he appears in this saga, is not a prominent figure in it.
This piece is perhaps the finest, most pathetic, and best-conceived
of any in the whole range of our literature. But
like much of that literature it exists in the most various
recensions, and there are different accounts given of the death
of all the principal characters.</p>

<p>This saga commences with the birth of Déirdre. King
Conor and his Ultonians had gone to drink and feast in the
house of Felim, Conor's chief story-teller, and during their
stay there Felim's wife gives birth to a daughter. Cathba the
Druid prophesies concerning the infant, and foretells that much
woe and great calamities shall yet come upon Ulster because
of her. He names her Déirdre.<a name="FNanchor_1_449" id="FNanchor_1_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_449" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Ultonians are smitten
with horror at his prophecies, and order her to be instantly put
to death. The most ancient text, that of the twelfth-century
Book of Leinster, tells the beginning of this saga exceedingly
tersely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Let the girl be slain,' cried the warriors. 'Not so,' said King
Conor, 'but bring ye her to me to-morrow; she shall be brought up
as I shall order, and she shall be the woman whom I shall marry.'
The Ultonians ventured not to contradict the King; they did as he
commanded.</p>

<p>"Déirdre was brought up in Conor's house. She became the
handsomest maiden in Ireland. She was reared in a house apart: no
man was allowed to see her until she should become Conor's wife.
No one was permitted to enter the house except her tutor, her nurse,
and Lavarcam,<a name="FNanchor_2_450" id="FNanchor_2_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_450" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> whom they ventured not to keep out, for she was a
druidess magician whose incantations they feared.</p>

<p>"One winter day Déirdre's tutor slew a young tender calf upon
the snow outside the house, which he was to cook for his pupil.
She beheld a raven drinking the blood upon the snow. She said to
Lavarcam, 'The only man I could love would be one who should
have those three colours, hair black as the raven, cheeks red as the
blood, body white as the snow.' 'Thou hast an opportunity,'
answered Lavarcam, 'the man whom thou desirest is not far off,
he is close to thee in the palace itself; he is Naesi, son of Usnach.'
'I shall not be happy,' answered Déirdre, 'until I have seen him.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>This famous story "which is known," as Dr. Cameron puts
it, "over all the lands of the Gael, both in Ireland and
Scotland,"<a name="FNanchor_3_451" id="FNanchor_3_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_451" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has been more fortunate than any other in the
whole range of Irish literature, for it has engaged the attention
of, and been edited from different texts by, nearly every great
Celtic scholar of this century.<a name="FNanchor_4_452" id="FNanchor_4_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_452" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Yet I luckily discovered last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
year in the museum in Belfast by far the amplest and most
graphic version of them all, bound up with some other pieces
of different dates. It was copied at the end of the last or the
beginning of the present century by a northern scribe, from
a copy which must have been fairly old to judge from the
language and from the glosses in the margin. I give here a
literal translation of the opening of the story from this manuscript,
and it is an admirable example of the later extension and
embellishment of the ancient texts.</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>THE OPENING OF THE FATE OF THE SONS OF USNACH,<br />
FROM A MS. IN THE BELFAST MUSEUM.</h4>


<p>"Once upon a time Conor, son of Fachtna, and the nobles of the
Red Branch, went to a feast to the house of Feidhlim, the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Doll, the king's principal story-teller; and the King and people were
merry and light hearted, eating that feast in the house of the principal
story-teller, with gentle music of the musicians, and with the
melody of the voices of the bards and the ollavs, with the delight of
the speech and ancient tales of the sages, and of those who read the
keenes (?) (written on) flags and books; (listening) to the prognostications
of the druids and of those who numbered the moon and
stars. And at the time when the assembly were merry and pleasant
in general it chanced that Feidhlim's wife bore a beautiful, well-shaped
daughter, during the feast. Up rises expeditiously the gentle
Cathfaidh, the Head-druid of Erin, who chanced to be present in the
assembly at that time, and a bundle of his ancient ...? fairy books
in his left hand with him, and out he goes on the border of the rath
to minutely observe and closely scrutinise the clouds of the air, the
position of the stars and the age of the moon, to gain a prognostication
and a knowledge of the fate that was in store for the child
who was born there. Cathfaidh then returns quickly to all in
presence of the King and told them an omen and prophecy, that
many hurts and losses should come to the province of Ulster on
account of the girl that was born there. On the nobles of Ulster
receiving this prophecy they resolved on the plan of destroying the
infant, and the heroes of the Red Branch bade slay her without
delay.</p>

<p>"'Let it not be so done,' says the King; 'it is not laudable to fight
against fate, and woe to him who would destroy an innocent infant,
for agreeable is the appearance and the laugh of the child; alas! it
were a pity to quench her (life). Observe, O ye Nobles of Ulster,
and listen to me, O ye valiant heroes of the Red Branch, and understand
that I still submit to the omen of the prophecies and foretellings
of the seers, but yet I do not submit to, nor do I praise, the
committing of a base deed, or a deed of treachery, in the hope of
quenching the anger of the power of the elements. If it be a fate
which it is not possible to avoid, give ye, each of you, death to
himself, but do not shed the blood of the innocent infant, for it were
not (our) due (to have) prosperity thereafter. I proclaim to you,
moreover, O ye nobles of Emania, that I take the girl under my
own protection from henceforth, and if I and she live and last, it
may be that I shall have her as my one-wife and gentle consort.
Therefore, I assure the men of Erin by the securities of the moon
and sun, that any one who would venture to destroy her either now
or again, shall neither live nor last, if I survive her.'</p>

<p>"The nobles of Ulster, and every one in general listened silent and
mute, until Conall Cearnach, Fergus mac Roigh, and the heroes of
the Red Branch rose up together, and 'twas what they said, 'O High-king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
of Ulster, right is thy judgment, and it is (our) due to observe
it, and let it be thy will that is done.'</p>

<p>"As for the girl, Conor took her under his own protection, and
placed her in a moat apart, to be brought up by his nurse, whose
name was Lavarcam, in a fortress of the Red Branch, and Conor
and Cathfaidh the druid gave her the name of Déirdre. Afterwards
Déirdre was being generously nurtured under Lavarcam and (other)
ladies, perfecting her in every science that was fitting for the
daughter of a high prince, until she grew up a blossom-bearing
sapling, and until her beauty was beyond every degree surpassing.
Moreover, she was nurtured with excessive luxury of meat and drink
that her stature and ripeness might be the greater for it, and that
she might be the sooner marriageable. This is how Déirdre's abode
was (situated, namely) in a fortress of the Branch, according to the
King's command, every (aperture for) light closed in the front of the
dún, and the windows of the back (ordered) to be open. A beautiful
orchard full of fruit (lay) at the back of the fort, in which Déirdre
might be walking for a while under the eye of her tutor at the
beginning and the end of the day; under the shade of the fresh
boughs and branches, and by the side of a running, meandering
stream that was winding softly through the middle of the walled
garden. A high, tremendous difficult wall, not easy to surmount,
(was) surrounding that spacious habitation, and four savage man-hounds
(sent) from Conor (were) on constant guard there, and his
life were in peril for the man who would venture to approach it.
For it was not permitted to any male to come next nor near Déirdre,
nor even to look at her, but (only) to her tutor, whose name was
Cailcin, and to King Conor himself. Prosperous was Conor's sway,
and valiant was the fame (<i>i.e.</i>, famous was the valour) of the Red
Branch, defending the province of Ulster against foreigners and
against every other province in Erin in his time, and there were no
three in the household of Emania or throughout all Banba [Ireland]
more brilliant than the sons of Uisneach, nor heroes of higher fame
than they, Naoise [Neesh&#259;], Ainle, and Ardan.</p>

<p>"As for Déirdre, when she was fourteen years of age she was
found marriageable and Conor designed to take her to his own royal
couch. About this time a sadness and a heavy flood of melancholy
lay upon the young queen, without gentle sleep, without sufficient
food, without sprightliness&mdash;as had been her wont.</p>

<p>"Until it chanced of a day, while snow lay (on the ground),
in the winter, that Cailcin, Déirdre's tutor, went to kill a
calf to get ready food for her, and after shedding the blood of
the calf out upon the snow, a raven stoops upon it to drink it, and
as Déirdre perceives that, and she watching through a window of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the fortress, she heaved a heavy sigh so that Cailcin heard her.
'Wherefore thy melancholy, girl?' said he. 'Alas that I have not
yon thing as I see it,' said she. 'Thou shalt have that if it be
possible,' said he, drawing his hand dexterously so that he gave an
unerring cast of his knife at the raven, so that he cut one foot off it.
And after that he takes up the bird and throws it over near Déirdre.
The girl starts at once, and fell into a faint, until Lavarcam came up
to help her. 'Why art thou as I see thee, dear girl,' said she, 'for
thy countenance is pitiable ever since yesterday?' 'A desire that
came to me,' said Déirdre. 'What is that desire?' said Lavarcam.
'Three colours that I saw,' said Déirdre, 'namely, the blackness of
the raven, the redness of the blood, and the whiteness of the snow.'
'It is easy to get that for thee now,' said Lavarcam, and arose (and
went) out without delay, and she gathered the full of a vessel of
snow, and half the full of a cup of the calf's blood, and she pulls
three feathers out of the wing of the raven. And she laid them
down on the table before the girl. Déirdre began as though she
were eating the snow and lazily tasting the blood with the top of the
raven's feather, and her nurse closely scrutinising her, until Déirdre
asked Lavarcam to leave her alone by herself for a while. Lavarcam
departs, and again returns, and this is how she found Déirdre&mdash;shaping
a ball of snow in the likeness of a man's head and mottling
it with the top of the raven's feather out of the blood of the calf,
and putting the small black plumage as hair upon it, and she never
perceived her nurse examining her until she had finished. 'Whose
likeness is that?' said Lavarcam. Déirdre starts and she said,'It is
a work easily destroyed.' 'That work is a great wonder to me, girl,'
said Lavarcam, 'because it was not thy wont to draw pictures of a
man, (and) it was not permitted to the women of Emania to teach
thee any similitude but that of Conor only.' 'I saw a face in my
dream,' said Déirdre, 'that was of brighter countenance than the
King's face, or Cailcin's, and it was in it that I saw the three colours
that pained me, namely, the whiteness of the snow on his skin, the
blackness of the raven on his hair, and the redness of the blood
upon his countenance, and oh woe! my life will not last, unless I
get my desire.' 'Alas for thy desire, my darling,' said Lavarcam.
'My desire, O gentle nurse,' said Déirdre. 'Alas! 'tis a pity thy
desire, it is difficult to get it,' said Lavarcam, 'for fast and close is
the fortress of the Branch, and high and difficult is the enclosure
round about, and [there is] the sharp watch of the fierce man-hounds
in it.' 'The hounds are no danger to us,' said Déirdre.
'Where did you behold that face?' said Lavarcam. 'In a dream
yesterday,' said Déirdre, and she weeping, after hiding her face in
her nurse's bosom, and shedding tears plentifully. 'Rise up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
me, dear pupil,' said Lavarcam, 'and restrain thy tears henceforth
till thou eatest food and takest a drink, and after Cailcin's eating his
meal we shall talk together about the dream.' Her nurse raises
Déirdre's head, 'Take courage, daughter,' said she, 'and be patient,
for I am certain that thou shalt get thy desire, for according to
human age and life, Conor's time beside thee is not (to be) long or
lasting.'</p>

<p>"After Lavarcam's departing from her, she [Lavarcam] perceived
a green mantle hung in the front of a closed-up window on the
head of a brass club and the point of a spear thrust through the
wall of the mansion. Lavarcam puts her hand to it so that it readily
came away with her, and stones and moss fell down after it, so that
the light of day, and the grassy lawn, and the Champion's Plain in
front of the mansion, and the heroes at their feats of activity became
visible. 'I understand, now, my pupil,' said Lavarcam, 'that it was
here you saw that dream.' But Déirdre did not answer her. Her
nurse left food and ale on the table before Déirdre, and departed
from her without speaking, for the boring-through of the window
did not please Lavarcam, for fear of Conor or of Cailcin coming to
the knowledge of it. As for Déirdre, she ate not her food, but she
quenched her thirst out of a goblet of ale, and she takes with her
the flesh of the calf, after covering it under a corner of her mantle,
and she went to her tutor and asks leave of him to go out for a while
(and walk) at the back of the mansion. 'The day is cold, and there
is snow darkening in (the air) daughter,' said Cailcin, 'but you can
walk for a while under the shelter of the walls of the mansion, but
mind the house of the hounds.'</p>

<p>"Déirdre went out, and no stop was made by her until she passed
down through the middle of the snow to where the den of the man-hounds
was, and as soon as the hounds recognised her and the smell
of the meat they did not touch her, and they made no barking till
she divided her food amongst them, and she returns into the house
afterwards. Thereupon came Lavarcam, and found Déirdre lying
upon one side of her couch, and she sighing heavily and shedding
tears. Her nurse stood silent for a while observing her, till her heart
was softened to compassion and her anger departed from her. She
stretched out her hand, and 'twas what she said, 'Rise up, modest
daughter, that we may be talking about the dream, and tell me did
you ever see that black hero before yesterday?' 'White hero, gentle
nurse, hero of the pleasant crimson cheeks,' said Déirdre. 'Tell
me without falsehood,' said Lavarcam, 'did you ever see that warrior
before yesterday, or before you bored through the window-work
with the head of a spear and with a brass club, and till you looked
out through it on the warriors of the Branch when they were at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
their feats of activity on the Champion Plain, and till you saw all the
dreams you spoke of?' Déirdre hides her head in her nurse's
bosom, weeping, till she said, 'Oh, gentle mother and nurturer of
my heart, do not tell that to my tutor; and I shall not conceal from
thee that I saw him on the lawn of Emania, playing games with the
boys, and learning feats of valour, and och! he had the beautiful
countenance at that time, and very lovely was it yesterday (too).'
'Daughter,' said Lavarcam, 'you did not see the boys on the green
of Emania from the time you were seven years of age, and that is
seven years ago.' 'Seven bitter years,' said Déirdre, 'since I beheld
the delight of the green and the playing of the boys, and surely, too,
Naoise surpassed all the youths of Emania.' 'Naoise, the son of
Uisneach?' said Lavarcam. 'Naoise is his name, as he told me,' said
Déirdre, 'but I did not ask whose son he was.' 'As he told you!' said
Lavarcam. 'As he told me,' said Déirdre, 'when he made a throw of
a ball, by a miss-cast, backwards transversely over the heads of the
band of maidens that were standing on the edge of the green, and
I rose from amongst them all, till I lifted the ball, and I delivered
it to him, and he pressed my hand joyously.' 'He pressed your hand,
girl!' said Lavarcam. 'He pressed it lovingly, and said that he
would see me again, but it was difficult for him, and I did not see
him since until yesterday, and oh, gentle nurse, if you wish me to
be alive take a message to him from me, and tell him to come to
visit me and talk with me secretly to-night without the knowledge
of Cailcin or any other person.' 'Oh, girl,' said Lavarcam, it is a
very dangerous attempt to gain the quenching of thy desire [being
in peril] from the anger of the King, and under the sharp watch of
Cailcin, considering the fierceness of the savage man-hounds, and
considering the difficulty of (scaling) the enclosure round about.'
'The hounds are no danger to us,' said Déirdre. 'Then, too,' said
Lavarcam, 'great is Conor's love for the children of Uisneach, and
there is not in the Red Branch a hero dearer to him than Naoise.'
'If he be the son of Uisneach,' said Déirdre, 'I heard the report of
him from the women of Emania, and that great are his own territories
in the West of Alba, outside of Conor's sway, and, gentle
nurse, go to find Naoise, and you can tell him how I am, and how
much greater my love for him is than for Conor.' 'Tell him that
yourself if you can,' said Lavarcam, and she went out thereupon to
seek Naoise till he was found, and till he came with her to Déirdre's
dwelling in the beginning of the night, without Cailcin's knowledge.
When Naoise beheld the splendour of the girl's countenance he is
filled with a flood of love, and Déirdre beseeches him to take her and
escape to Alba. But Naoise thought that too hazardous, for fear of
Conor. But in the course (?) of the night Déirdre won him over, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
that he consented to her, and they determined to depart on the night
of the morrow.</p>

<p>"Déirdre escaped in the middle of the night without the knowledge
of her tutor or her nurse, for Naoise came at that time and his
two brothers along with him, so that he bored a gap at the back of
the hounds' den, for the dogs were dead already through poison from
Déirdre.</p>

<p>"They lifted the girl over the walls, through every rough impediment,
so that her mantle and the extremity of her dress were all
tattered, and he set her upon the back of a steed, and no stop was
made by them till (they reached) Sliabh Fuaid and Finn-charn of
the watch, till they came to the harbour and went aboard a ship and
were driven by a south wind across the ocean-waters and over the
back-ridges of the deep sea to Loch n-Eathaigh in the west of
Alba, and thrice fifty valiant champions [sailed] along with them,
namely, fifty with each of the three brothers, Naoise, Ainle, and
Ardan."</p></blockquote>

<p>The three brothers and Déirdre lived for a long time happily
in Scotland and rose to great favour and power with the King,
until he discovered the existence of the beautiful Déirdre,
whom they had carefully kept concealed lest he should desire
her for his wife. This discovery drives them forth again, and
they live by hunting in the highlands and islands.</p>

<p>It is only at this point that most of the modern copies, such
as that published by O'Flanagan in 1808, begin, namely,
with a feast of King Conor's, in which he asks his household
and all the warriors of Ulster who are present, whether they
are aware of anything lacking to his palace in Emania. They
all reply that to them it seems perfect. "Not so to me,"
answers Conor, "I know of a great want which presseth upon
you, namely, three renowned youths, the three luminaries of
the valour of the Gaels, the three beautiful, noble sons of
Usnach, to be wanting to you on account of any woman in
the world." "Dared we say that," said they, "long since
would we have said it."</p>

<p>Conor thereupon proposes to send ambassadors to them to
solicit their return. He takes Conall Cearnach apart and asks
him if he will go, and what would he do should the sons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Usnach be slain while under his protection. Conall answers
that he would slay without mercy any Ultonian who dared to
touch one of them. So does Cuchulain. Fergus mac Róigh
alone promises not to injure the King himself should he touch
them, but any other Ultonian who should wrong them must
die. Fergus and his two sons sailed to Alba, commissioned to
proclaim peace to the sons of Usnach and bring them home.
Having landed, Fergus gives forth the cry of a "mighty man
of chace." Naoise and Déirdre were sitting together in their
hunting booth playing at chess. Naoise heard the cry and said,
"I hear the call of a man of Erin." "That was not the call
of a man of Erin," said Déirdre, "but the call of a man of
Alba." Twice again did Fergus shout, and twice did Déirdre
insist that it was not the cry of a man of Erin. At last Naoise
recognises the voice of Fergus, and sends his brother to meet
him. Then Déirdre confesses that she had recognised the call
of Fergus from the beginning. "Why didst thou conceal it
then, my queen?" said Naoise. "A vision I had last night,"
said Déirdre, "for three birds came to us from Emania having
three sups of honey in their beaks, and they left them with
us, but they took with them three sups of our blood." "And
how readest thou that, my queen," said Naoise. "It is," said
Déirdre, "the coming of Fergus to us with a peaceful message
from Conor, for honey is not more sweet than the peaceful
message of the false man."</p>

<p>But all is of no avail. Fergus and his sons arrive and spend the
night with the children of Usnach, and despite of all that Déirdre
can do, she sees them slowly win her husband round to their
side, and inspire him with a desire to return once more to Erin.</p>

<p>Next morning they embark. Déirdre weeps and utters
lamentations; she sings her bitter regret at leaving the scenes
where she had been so happy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Delightful land," she sang, "yon eastern land, Alba, with its
wonders. I had never come hither out of it had I not come with
Naoise....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Vale of Laidh, Oh in the Vale of Laidh, I used to sleep
under soft coverlet; fish and venison and the fat of the badger were
my repast in the Vale of Laidh.</p>

<p>"The Vale of Masan, oh the Vale of Masan, high its harts-tongue,
fair its stalks, we used to enjoy a rocking sleep above the grassy
verge of Masan.<a name="FNanchor_5_453" id="FNanchor_5_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_453" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"The vale of Eiti, oh the vale of Eiti! In it I raised my first
house, lovely was its wood (when seen) on rising, the milking-house
of the sun was the vale of Eiti.</p>

<p>"Glendarua, oh Glendarua! my love to every one who enjoys it;
sweet the voice of the cuckoo upon bending bough upon the cliff
above Glendarua.</p>

<p>"Dear is Droighin over the strong shore. Dear are its waters
over pure sand; I would never have come from it had I not come
with my love."</p></blockquote>

<p>She ceased to sing, the vessel approached the shore, and the
fugitives are landed once more in Erin. But dangers thicken
round them. Through a strategy of King Conor's Fergus is
placed under <i>geasa</i> or tabu by a man called Barach to stay
and partake of a feast with him, and thus detached from the
sons of Usnach, who are left alone with his two sons instead.
Then Déirdre again uses all her influence with her husband
and his brothers to sail to Rathlin and wait there until they
can be rejoined by Fergus, but she does not prevail. After
that she has a terrifying dream, and tells it to them, but
Naoise answered lightly in verse&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thy mouth pronounceth not but evil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O maiden, beautiful, incomparable;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The venom of thy delicate ruby mouth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fall on the hateful furious foreigners."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Thereafter, as they advanced farther upon their way towards
King Conor's palace at Emania, the omens of evil grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
thicker still, and all Déirdre's terrors are re-awakened by the
rising of a blood-red cloud.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'O Naoise, view the cloud</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I see here on the sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see over Emania green</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A chilling cloud of blood-tinged red.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have caught alarm from the cloud</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see here in the sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is like a gore-clot of blood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cloud terrific very-thin.'"</span><br />
</p>

<p>And she urged them to turn aside to Cuchulain's palace at
Dundalgan, and remain under that hero's safeguard till Fergus
could rejoin them. But she cannot persuade the others that
the treachery which she herself sees so clearly is really intended.
Her last despairing attempt is made as they come in sight of
the royal city; she tells them that if, when they arrive, they
are admitted into the mansion in which King Conor is
feasting with the nobles of Ulster round him, they are safe, but
if they are on any pretext quartered by the King in the
House of the Red Branch, they may be certain of treachery.
They <i>are</i> sent to the House of the Red Branch, and not
admitted among the King's revellers, on the pretended grounds
that the Red Branch is better prepared for strangers, and that
its larder and its cellar are better provided with food and drink
than the King's mansion. All now begin to feel that the net
is closing over them. Late in the night King Conor, fired
with drink and jealousy, called for some one to go for him and
bring him word how Déirdre looked, "for if her own form live
upon her, there is not in the world a woman more beautiful
than she." Lavarcam, the nurse, undertakes to go. She, of
course, discloses to Déirdre and Naoise the treachery that is
being plotted against them, and returning to Conor she tells
him that Déirdre has wholly lost her beauty, whereat, "much
of his jealousy abated, and he continued to indulge in feasting
and enjoyment a long while, until he thought of Déirdre a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
second time." This time he does not trust Lavarcam, but
sends one of his retainers, first reminding him that his
father and his three brothers had been slain by Naoise. But
in the mean time the entrances and windows of the Red
Branch had been shut and barred and the doors barricaded by
the sons of Usnach. One small window, however, had been
left open at the back and the spy climbed upon a ladder and
looked through it and saw Naoise and Déirdre sitting together
and playing at chess. Déirdre called Naoise's attention to the
face looking at them, and Naoise, who was lifting a chessman
off the board, hurled it at the head and broke the eye that
looked at them. The man ran back and told the King that
it was worth losing an eye to have beheld a woman so lovely.
Then Conor, fired with fury and jealousy, led his troops to the
assault, and all night long there is fighting and shouting round
the Red Branch House, and Naoise's brothers, helped by the
two sons of Fergus, pass the night in repelling attack, and in
quenching the fires that break out all round the house. At
length one of Fergus's sons is slain and the other is bought off
by a bribe of land and a promise of power from King Conor,
and now the morning begins to dawn, but the sons of Usnach
are still living, and Déirdre is still untaken. At last Conor's
druid, Cathba, consents to work a spell against them if
Conor will plight his faithful word that having once taken
Déirdre he will not touch or harm the sons of Usnach. Conor
plights his word and troth, and the spell is set at work. The
sons of Usnach had left the half-burnt house and were
escaping in the morning light with Déirdre between them
when they met, as they thought, a sea of thick viscid waves,
and they cast down their weapons and spread abroad their arms
and tried to swim, and Conor's soldiers came and took them
without a blow. They were brought to Conor and he caused
them to be at once beheaded. It was then the druid cursed
Emania, for Conor had broken his plighted word, and that
curse was fulfilled in the misery that fell upon the province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
during the wars with Mève. He cursed also the house of
Conor, and prophesied that none of his descendants should
possess Emania for ever, "and that," adds the saga, "has been
verified, for neither Conor nor any of his race possessed Emania
from that time to this."<a name="FNanchor_6_454" id="FNanchor_6_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_454" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>As for Déirdre, she was as one distracted; she fell upon the
ground and drank their blood, she tore her hair and rent her
dishevelled tresses, and the lament she broke forth into has long
been a favourite of Irish scribes. She calls aloud upon the
dead, "the three falcons of the mount of Culan, the three
lions of wood of the cave, the three sons of the breast of the
Ultonians, the three props of the battalion of Chuailgne, the
three dragons of the fort of Monadh."</p>

<p>After her lay of lamentation she falls into the grave where the
three are being buried, and dies above them. "Their flag
was raised over their tomb, and their names were written in
Ogam, and their funeral games were celebrated. Thus far
the tragedy of the sons of Usnach."</p>

<p>The oldest and briefest version of this fine saga, that preserved
in the Book of Leinster, ends differently, and even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
tragically. On the death of Naoise, who is slain the moment
he appears on the lawn of Emania, Déirdre is taken, her
hands are bound behind her back and she is given over to
Conor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Déirdre was for a year in Conor's couch, and during that year
she neither smiled nor laughed nor took sufficiency of food, drink,
or sleep, nor did she raise her head from her knee. When they
used to bring the musicians to her house she would utter rhapsody&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'Lament ye the mighty warriors</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Assassinated in Emania on coming,' etc.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"When Conor would be endeavouring to sooth her, it was then she
would utter this dirge&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'That which was most beauteous to me beneath the sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And which was most lovely to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou hast taken from me&mdash;great the anguish&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shall not get healed of it to my death,' etc.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"'What is it you see that you hate most?' said Conor.</p>

<p>"'Thou thyself and Eoghan [Owen] son of Duthrecht,'<a name="FNanchor_8_456" id="FNanchor_8_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_456" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> said she.</p>

<p>"'Thou shalt be a year in Owen's couch then,' said Conor. Conor
then gave her over to Owen.</p>

<p>"They drove the next day to the assembly at Muirtheimhne. She
was behind Owen in a chariot. She looked towards the earth that
she might not see her two gallants.</p>

<p>"'Well, Déirdre,' said Conor, 'it is the glance of a ewe between
two rams you cast between me and Owen.'</p>

<p>"There was a large rock near. She hurled her head at the stone,
so that she broke her skull and was dead.</p>

<p>"This is the exile of the sons of Usnach and the cause of the exile
of Fergus and of the death of Déirdre."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was in consequence of Conor's treachery in slaying the
sons of Usnach while under Fergus's protection that this
warrior turned against his king, burnt Emania, and then seceded
into Connacht to Oilioli [Ulyul] and Mève, king and queen
of that province, where he took service with about fifteen
hundred Ultonians who, indignant at Conor, seceded along with
him. "It was he," says Keating, summing up the substance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
the sagas, "who carried off the great spoils from Ulster whence
came so many wars and enmities between the people of Connacht
and Ulster, so that the exiles who went from Ulster
into banishment with Fergus continued seven, or as some say,
ten years in Connacht, during which time they kept constantly
spoiling, destroying and plundering the Ultonians, on account
of the murder of the sons of Usnach. And the Ultonians in
like manner wreaked vengeance upon them, and upon the
people of Connacht, and made reprisals for the booty which
Fergus had carried off, and for every other evil inflicted upon
them by the exiles and by the Connacht men, insomuch that
the losses and injuries sustained on both sides were so numerous
that whole volumes have been written upon them, which
would be too long to mention or take notice of at present."</p>

<p>It was with the assistance of Fergus and the other exiles
that Mève undertook her famous expedition into Ulster, of
which we must now speak.</p>

which comprises the "Transactions of the Gaelic Society," as early as
1808. The older of these two versions agrees closely with that contained
in "Egerton, 1782," of the British Museum, but neither of the MSS. which
he used is now known to exist. Eugene O'Curry edited the story from
the text in the Yellow Book of Lecan, with a translation in the "Atlantis,"
a long defunct Irish periodical. Windisch edited the oldest existing
version, that of the Book of Leinster, in the first volume of "Irische Texte."
None of these three versions differ appreciably. In the second volume of
the same, Dr. Whitley Stokes edited a consecutive text from 56 and 53
of the MSS. in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh, the latter of which is
a vellum of the fifteenth century. Finally, the text of both these MSS.
was published in full in vol. ii. of Dr. Cameron's "Reliquiæ Celticæ,"
where he also gives a translation of the first. Keating, too, in his history,
retells the story at considerable length. Windisch's, O'Curry's, and
O'Flanagan's texts were reprinted in 1883 in the "Gaelic Journal." In
addition to all these Mr. Carmichael published in Gaelic in 1887 an
admirable folk-lore version of the story from the Isles of Scotland in the
thirteenth volume of the "Transactions of the Inverness Gaelic Society,"
and the tale is retold in English, chiefly from this version, by Mr. Jacobs
in the first series of his "Celtic Fairy Tales." M. d'Arbois de Jubainville
has given a French translation of the entire story from the Book of
Leinster, the older Edinburgh MS., and the Highland Folktale, the latter
two being translated by M. Georges Dottin. Macpherson made this story
the foundation of his "Darthula." Dr. Dwyer Joyce published the story in
America as an English poem. Sir Samuel Ferguson, Dr. Todhunter, and
the present writer have all published adaptations of it in English verse,
and Mr. Rolleston made it the subject of the Prize Cantata at the Féis
Ceóil in Dublin in 1897. Hence I may print here this new and full opening
of a piece so celebrated. For text see <i>Zeit. f. Celt. Phil.</i> II. 1, p. 142.</p></div>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h5>

<h4>THE TÁIN BO CHUAILGNE</h4>


<p>The greatest of the heroic sagas and the longest is that which
is called the Táin Bo Chuailgne,<a name="FNanchor_1_457" id="FNanchor_1_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_457" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or "Cattle-Raid of Cooley,"
a district of Ulster contained in the present county of Louth,
into which Oilioll and Méadhbh [Mève], the king and queen of
Connacht, led an enormous army composed of men from the
four other provinces, to carry off the celebrated Dun Bull of
Cooley.</p>

<p>Although there is a great deal of verbiage and piling-up of
rather barren names in this piece, nevertheless there are also
several finely conceived and well-executed incidents. The
saga which, according to Zimmer, was probably first committed
to writing in the seventh or eighth century, is partially preserved
in the Leabhar na h-Uidhre, a manuscript made about
the year 1100, and there is a complete copy of it in the Book
of Leinster made about fifty years later. I have chiefly translated
from a more modern text in my own possession, which
differs very slightly from the ancient ones.</p>

<p>The story opens with a conversation between Mève, queen
of Connacht, and Oilioll her husband, which ends in a dispute
as to which of them is the richest. There was no modern
Married Women's Property Act in force, but Irish ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
seem to have been at all times much more sympathetically
treated by the Celtic tribes than by the harder and more stern
races of Teutonic and Northern blood, and Irish damsels seem
to have been free to enjoy their own property and dowries.<a name="FNanchor_2_458" id="FNanchor_2_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_458" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The story, then, begins with this dispute as to which, husband
or wife, is the richer in this world's goods, and the argument
at last becomes so heated that the pair decide to have all their
possessions brought together to compare them one with another
and judge by actual observation which is the most valuable.
They collected accordingly jewels, bracelets, metal, gold, silver,
flocks, herds, ornaments, etc., and found that in point of wealth
they were much the same, but that there was one great bull called
Finn-bheannach or White-horned, who was really calved by one
of Mève's cows, but being endowed with a certain amount of
intelligence considered it disgraceful to be under a woman, and
so had gone over to Oilioll's herds. With him Mève had
nothing that could compare. She made inquiry, however, and
found out from her chief courier that there was in the district
of Cuailgne in Louth (Mève lived at Rathcroghan in Roscommon)
a most celebrated bull called the Dun Bull of Cuailgne
belonging to a chieftain of the name of Darè. To him
accordingly she sends an embassy requesting the loan of the
bull for one year, and promising fifty heifers in return. Darè
was quite willing, and promised to lend the animal. He was
in fact pleased, and treated the embassy generously, giving them
good lodgings with plenty of food and drink&mdash;too much drink
in fact. The fate of nations is said to often hang upon a
thread. On this occasion that of Ulster and Connacht depended
upon a drop more or less, absorbed by one of the ten
men who constituted Mève's embassy. This man unfortunately
passed the just limit, and Darè's steward coming in
at the moment heard him say that it was small thanks to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
master to give his bull "for if he hadn't given it we'd have
taken it." That word decided the fate of provinces. The
steward, indignant at such an outrage, ran and told his master,
and Darè swore that now he would lend no bull, and what
was more, but that the ten men were envoys he swore he
would hang them. With indignity they were dismissed, and
returned empty-handed to Mève's boundless indignation. She
in her turn swore she would have the bull in spite of Darè.
She immediately sent out to collect her armies, and invited
Leinster and Munster to join her. She was in fact able
to muster most of the three provinces to march against
Ulster to take the bull from Darè, and in addition she had
Fergus mac Roy and about fifteen hundred Ulster warriors
who had never returned to their homes nor forgiven Conor for
the murder of the sons of Usnach. She crossed the Shannon
at Athlone, and marched on to Kells, within a few miles of
Ulster, and there she pitched her standing camp. She was
accompanied by her husband and her daughter who was the
fairest among women. Her mother had secretly promised her
hand to every leader in her army in order to nerve them to do
their utmost.</p>

<p>At the very beginning Mève is forewarned by a mysterious
female of the slaughter which is to come. She had driven
round in her chariot to visit her druid and to inquire of him
what would come of her expedition, and is returning somewhat
reassured in her mind by the druid's promise which was&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Whosoever returneth or returneth not, thou shalt return,' and,"
says the saga, "as Mève returned again upon her track she beheld a
thing which caused her to wonder, a single woman (riding) beside
her, upon the pole of her chariot. And this is how that maiden was.
She was weaving a border with a sword of bright bronze<a name="FNanchor_3_459" id="FNanchor_3_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_459" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in
her right hand with its seven rings of red gold, and, about her, a
spotted speckled mantle of green, and a fastening brooch in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
mantle over her bosom. A bright red gentle generous countenance,
a grey eye visible in her head, a thin red mouth, young pearly teeth
she had. You would think that her teeth were a shower of white
pearls flung into her head. Her mouth was like fresh coral? [<i>partaing</i>].
The melodious address of her voice and her speaking tones
were sweeter than the strings of curved harp being played. Brighter
than the snow of one night was the splendour of her skin showing
through her garments, her feet long, fairy-like, with (well) turned
nails. Fair yellow hair very golden on her. Three tresses of her
hair round her head, one tress behind falling after her to the extremities
of her ankles.</p>

<p>"Mève looks at her. 'What makest thou there, O maiden?' said
Mève.</p>

<p>"'Foreseeing thy future for thee, and thy grief, thou who art
gathering the four great provinces of Ireland with thee to the land of
Ulster, to carry out the Táin Bo Chuailgne.'</p>

<p>"'And wherefore doest thou me this?" said Mève.</p>

<p>"'Great reason have I for it,' said the maiden. 'A handmaid of
thy people (am I),' said she.</p>

<p>"'Who of my people art thou?' said Mève.</p>

<p>"'Féithlinn, fairy-prophetess of Rathcroghan, am I,' said she.</p>

<p>"'It is well, O Féithlinn, prophetess,' said Mève, 'and how seest
thou our hosts?'</p>

<p>"'I see crimson over them, I see red,' said she.</p>

<p>"'Conor is in his sickness<a name="FNanchor_4_460" id="FNanchor_4_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_460" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in Emania,' said Mève, 'and messengers
have reached me from him, and there is nothing that I dread from
the Ultonians, but speak thou the truth, O Féithlinn, prophetess,' said
Mève.</p>

<p>"'I see crimson, I see red,' said she.</p>

<p>"'Comhsgraidh Meann ... is in Innis Comhsgraidh in his sickness,
and my messengers have reached me, and there is nothing that
I fear from the Ultonians, but speak me truth, O Féithlinn, prophetess,
how seest thou our host?'</p>

<p>"'I see crimson, I see red.'</p>

<p>"'Celtchar, son of Uitheachar, is in his sickness,' said Mève, 'and
there is nothing I dread from the Ultonians, but speak truth, O
Féithlinn, prophetess.'</p>

<p>"'I see crimson, I see red,' said she.</p>

<p>"' ...?' said Mève, 'for since the men of Erin will be in one place
there will be disputes and fightings and irruptions amongst them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
about reaching the beginnings or endings of fords or rivers, and
about the first woundings of boars and stags, of venison, or matter of
venery, speak true, O Féithlinn, prophetess, how seest thou our host?
said Mève.</p>

<p>"'I see crimson I see red,' said she."</p></blockquote>

<p>After this follows a long poem, wherein "she foretold
Cuchulain to the men of Erin."</p>

<p>The march of Mève's army is told with much apparent
exactness. The names of fifty-nine places through which it
passed are given; and many incidents are recorded, one of
which shows the furious, jealous, and vindictive disposition of
the amazon queen herself. She, who seems to have taken upon
herself the entire charge of the hosting, had made in her chariot
the full round of the army at their encamping for the night, to
see that everything was in order. After that she returned to
her own tent and sat beside her husband Olioill at their meal,
and he asks her how fared the troops. Mève then said something
laudatory about the Gaileóin,<a name="FNanchor_5_461" id="FNanchor_5_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_461" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or ancient Leinstermen, who were
not of Gaelic race, but appear to have belonged to some early
non-Gaelic tribe, cognate with the Firbolg.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'What excellence perform they beyond all others that they be
thus praised?' said Oilioll.</p>

<p>"'They give cause for praise,' said Mève, 'for while others were
choosing their camping-ground, they had made their booths and
shelters; and while others were making their booths and shelters,
they had their feast of meat and ale laid out; and while others were
laying out their feasts of bread and ale, these had finished their food
and fare; and while others were finishing their food and fare, these
were asleep. Even as their slaves and servants have excelled the
slaves and servants of the men of Erin, so will their good heroes and
youths excel the good heroes and youths of the men of Erin in this
hosting.'</p>

<p>"'I am the better pleased at that,' said Oilioll, 'because it was
with me they came, and they are my helpers.'<a name="FNanchor_6_462" id="FNanchor_6_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_462" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>"'They shall not march with thee, then,' said Mève, 'and it is not
before me, nor to me, they shall be boasted of.'</p>

<p>"'Then let them remain in camp,' said Oilioll.</p>

<p>"'They shall not do that either,' said Mève.</p>

<p>"'What shall they do, then?' said Findabar, daughter of Oilioll
and Mève, 'if they shall neither march nor yet remain in camp.'</p>

<p>"'My will is to inflict death and fate and destruction on them,'
said Mève."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is with the greatest difficulty that Fergus is enabled to
calm the furious queen, and she is only satisfied when the
three thousand Gaileóins have been broken up and scattered
throughout the other battalions, so that no five men of them
remained together.</p>

<p>Thereafter the army came to plains so thickly wooded, in
the neighbourhood of the present Kells, that they were obliged
to cut down the wood with their swords to make a way for
their chariots, and the next night they suffered intolerably
from a fall of snow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The snow that fell that night reached to men's legs and to the
wheels of chariots, so that the snow made one plain of the five
provinces of Erin, and the men of Ireland never suffered so much
before in camp, none knew throughout the whole night whether it
was his friend or his enemy who was next him, until the rise early
on the morrow of the clear-shining sun, glancing on the snow that
covered the country."</p></blockquote>

<p>They are now on the borders of Ulster, and Cuchulain is
hovering on their flank, but no one has yet seen him. He
lops a gnarled tree, writes an Ogam on it, sticks upon it the
heads of three warriors he had slain, and sets it up on the brink
of a ford. That night Oilioll and Mève inquire from the
Ultonians who were in her army more particulars about this
new enemy, and nearly a sixth part of the whole Táin is
taken up by the stories which are then and there related
about Cuchulain's earliest history and exploits, first by
Fergus, and, when he is done relating, by Cormac Conlingeas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
and when he has finished, by Fiacha, another Ultonian.
This long digression, which is one of the most interesting
parts of the whole saga, being over, we return to the direct
story.</p>

<p>Cuchulain, who knows every tree and every bush of the
country, still hangs upon Mève's flank, and without showing
himself during the day, he slays a hundred men with his sling<a name="FNanchor_7_463" id="FNanchor_7_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_463" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
every night.</p>

<p>Mève, through an envoy, asks for a meeting with him, and
is astonished to find him, as she thinks, a mere boy. She offers
him great rewards in the hope of buying him off, but he will
have none of her gold. The only conditions upon which he
will cease his night-slaying is if Mève will promise to let
him fight with some warrior every day at the ford, and will
promise to keep her army in its camp while these single
combats last, and this Mève consents to, since she says it is
better to lose one warrior every day than one hundred every
night.</p>

<p>A great number of single combats then take place, each of
which is described at length. One curious incident is that
of the war-goddess, whom he had previously offended, the
Mór-rígu,<a name="FNanchor_8_464" id="FNanchor_8_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_464" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or "great queen," attacking him while fighting
with the warrior Loich. She came against him, not in her
own figure, but as a great black eel in the water, who wound
itself around his legs, and as he stooped to disengage himself
Loich wounded him severely in the breast. Again she came
against him in the form of a great grey wolf-bitch, and as
Cuchulain turned to drive her off he was again wounded. A
third time she came against him as a heifer with fifty other
heifers round her, but Cuchulain struck her and broke one of
her eyes, just as Diomede in the Iliad wounds the goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Cypris when she appears against him.<a name="FNanchor_9_465" id="FNanchor_9_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_465" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Cuchulain, thus
embarrassed, only rids himself of Loich by having recourse to
the mysterious feat of the Gae-Bolg, about which we shall
hear more later on. His opponent, feeling himself mortally
hurt, cries out&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'By thy love of generosity I crave a boon.'</p>

<p>"'What boon is that?' said Cuchulain.</p>

<p>"'It is not to spare me I ask,' said Loich, 'but let me fall forwards
to the east, and not backward to the west, that none of the men of
Erin may say that I fell in panic or in flight before thee.'</p>

<p>"'I grant it,' said Cuchulain, 'for surely it is a warrior's request.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>After this encounter Cuchulain grew terribly despondent,
and urged his charioteer Laeg again to hasten the men of
Ulster to his assistance, but their pains were still upon them,
and he is left alone to bear the brunt of the attack as best he
may. Mève also breaks her compact by sending six men
against him, but them he overcomes, and in revenge begins
again to slay at night.</p>

<p>Thereafter follows the episode known in Irish saga as the
Great Breach of Moy Muirtheimhne. Cuchulain, driven to
despair and enfeebled by wounds, fatigue, and watching, was
in the act of ascending his chariot to advance alone against the
men of the four provinces, moving to certain death, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
eye of his charioteer is arrested by the figure of a tall stranger
moving through the camp of the enemy, saluting none as he
moved, and by none saluted.</p>

<p>"That man," said Cuchulain, "must be one of my supernatural
friends of the shee<a name="FNanchor_10_466" id="FNanchor_10_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_466" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> folk, and they salute him not
because he is not seen."</p>

<p>The stranger approaches, and, addressing Cuchulain, desires
him to sleep for three days and three nights, and instantly
Cuchulain fell asleep, for he had been from before the feast
of Samhain till after Féil Bhrighde<a name="FNanchor_11_467" id="FNanchor_11_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_467" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> without sleep, "unless
it were that he might sleep a little while beside his spear,
in the middle of the day, his head on his hand, and his hand
on his spear, and his spear on his knee, but all the while
slaughtering, slaying, preying on, and destroying, the four
great provinces."</p>

<p>It was after this long sleep of Cuchulain's that, awaking
fresh and strong, the Berserk rage fell upon him. He hurled
himself against the men of Erin, he drove round their flank,
he "gave his chariot the heavy turn, so that the iron wheels
of the chariot sank into the earth, so that the track of the
iron wheels was (in itself) a sufficient fortification, for like a
fortification the stones and pillars and flags and sands of the
earth rose back high on every side round the wheels." All
that day, refreshed by his three days' sleep, he slaughtered the
men of Erin.</p>

<p>Other single combats take place after this, in one of which
the druid Cailitin and his twenty sons would have slain him
had he not been rescued by his countryman Fiacha, one of
those Ultonians who with Fergus had turned against their king
and country when the children of Usnach were slain.</p>

<p>It was only at the last that his own friend Ferdiad was
despatched against him, through the wiles of Mève. Ferdiad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
was not a Gael, but of the Firbolg or Firdomhnan race,<a name="FNanchor_12_468" id="FNanchor_12_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_468" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> yet
he proved very nearly a match for Cuchulain. Knowing what
Mève wanted with him, he positively refused to come to her
tent when sent for, and in the end he is only persuaded by her
sending her druids and ollavs against him, who threatened
"to criticise, satirise, and blemish him, so that they would
raise three blisters<a name="FNanchor_13_469" id="FNanchor_13_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_469" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> on his face unless he came with them." At
last he went with them in despair, "because he thought it
easier to fall by valour and championship and weapons than to
fall by [druids'] wisdom and by reproach."</p>

<p>The fight with Ferdiad is perhaps the finest episode in the
Táin. The following is a description of the conduct of the
warriors after the first day's conflict.</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>THE FIGHT AT THE FORD.<a name="FNanchor_14_470" id="FNanchor_14_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_470" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></h4>


<p>"They ceased fighting and threw their weapons away from them
into the hands of their charioteers. Each of them approached the
other forthwith and each put his hand round the other's neck and
gave him three kisses. Their horses were in the same paddock that
night, and their charioteers at the same fire; and their charioteers
spread beds of green rushes for them with wounded men's pillows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
to them. The professors of healing and curing came to heal and
cure them, and they applied herbs and plants of healing and curing
to their stabs, and their cuts, and their gashes, and to all their
wounds. Of every herb and of every healing and curing plant that
was put to the stabs and cuts and gashes, and to all the wounds of
Cuchulain, he would send an equal portion from him, westward
over the ford to Ferdiad, so that the men of Erin might not be able
to say, should Ferdiad fall by him, that it was by better means of
cure that he was enabled to kill him.</p>

<p>"Of each kind of food and of palatable pleasant intoxicating
drink that was sent by the men of Erin to Ferdiad, he would send a
fair moiety over the ford northwards to Cuchulain, because the
purveyors of Ferdiad were more numerous than the purveyors of
Cuchulain. All the men of Erin were purveyors to Ferdiad for
beating off Cuchulain from them, but the Bregians only were
purveyors to Cuchulain, and they used to come to converse with
him at dusk every night. They rested there that night."</p></blockquote>

<p>The narrator goes on to describe the next day's fighting,
which was carried on from their chariots "with their great
broad spears," and which left them both in such evil plight
that the professors of healing and curing "could do nothing
more for them, because of the dangerous severity of their
stabs and their cuts and their gashes and their numerous
wounds, than to apply witchcraft and incantations and charms
to them to staunch their blood and their bleeding and their
gory wounds."</p>

<p>Their meeting on the next day follows thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They arose early the next morning and came forward to the
ford of battle, and Cuchulain perceived an ill-visaged and a greatly
lowering cloud on Ferdiad that day.</p>

<p>"'Badly dost thou appear to-day, O Ferdiad,' said Cuchulain,
'thy hair has become dark this day and thine eye has become
drowsy, and thine own form and features and appearance have
departed from thee.'</p>

<p>"'It is not from fear or terror of thee that I am so this day,' said
Ferdiad, 'for there is not in Erin this day a champion that I could
not subdue.'</p>

<p>"And Cuchulain was complaining and bemoaning and he spake
these words, and Ferdiad answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>
CUCHULAIN.<br />
"Oh, Ferdiad, is it thou?<br />
Wretched man thou art I trow,<br />
By a guileful woman won<br />
To hurt thine old companion.<br />
<br />
FERDIAD.<br />
"O Cuchulain, fierce of fight,<br />
Man of wounds and man of might,<br />
Fate compelleth each to stir<br />
Moving towards his sepulchre."<a name="FNanchor_15_471" id="FNanchor_15_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_471" class="fnanchor">[15]</a><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The lay is then given, each of the heroes reciting a verse in
turn, and it is very possibly upon these lays that the prose
narrative is built up. The third day's fighting is then
described in which the warriors use their "heavy hand-smiting
swords," or rather swords that gave "blows of
size. "<a name="FNanchor_16_472" id="FNanchor_16_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_472" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The story then continues&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They cast away their weapons from them into the hands of
their charioteers, and though it had been the meeting pleasant and
happy, griefless and spirited of two men that morning, it was the
separation, mournful, sorrowful, dispirited, of the two men that
night.</p>

<p>"Their horses were not in the same enclosure that night. Their
charioteers were not at the same fire. They rested that night
there.</p>

<p>"Then Ferdiad arose early next morning and went forwards alone
to the ford of battle, for he knew that that day would decide the battle
and the fight, and he knew that one of them would fall on that day
there or that they both would fall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Ferdiad displayed many noble, wonderful, varied feats on high
that day, which he never learned with any other person, neither
with Scathach, nor with Uathach, nor with Aife, but which were
invented by himself that day against Cuchulain.</p>

<p>"Cuchulain came to the ford and he saw the noble, varied,
wonderful, numerous feats which Ferdiad displays on high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I perceive these, my friend, Laeg' [said Cuchulain to his
charioteer], 'the noble, varied, wonderful, numerous feats which
Ferdiad displays on high, and all these feats will be tried on me in
succession, and, therefore, it is that if it be I who shall begin to
yield this day thou art to excite, reproach, and speak evil to me, so
that the ire of my rage and anger shall grow the more on me. If it
be I who prevail, then thou shalt laud me, and praise me, and speak
good words to me that my courage may be greater.'<a name="FNanchor_17_473" id="FNanchor_17_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_473" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>"'It shall so be done indeed, O Cuchulain,' said Laeg.</p>

<p>"And it was then Cuchulain put his battle-suit of conflict and of
combat and of fight on him, and he displayed noble, varied, wonderful,
numerous feats on high on that day, that he never learned from
anybody else, neither with Scathach, nor with Uathach, nor with
Aife. Ferdiad saw those feats and he knew they would be plied
against him in succession.</p>

<p>"'What weapons shall we resort to, O Ferdiad?' said Cuchulain.</p>

<p>"'To thee belongs thy choice of weapons till night,' said Ferdiad.</p>

<p>"'Let us try the Ford Feat then,' said Cuchulain.</p>

<p>"'Let us indeed,' said Ferdiad. Although Ferdiad thus spoke his
consent it was a cause of grief to him to speak so, because he knew
that Cuchulain was used to destroy every hero and every champion
who contended with him in the Feat of the Ford.</p>

<p>"Great was the deed, now, that was performed on that day at the
ford&mdash;the two heroes, the two warriors, the two champions of
Western Europe, the two gift and present and stipend bestowing
hands of the north-west of the world; the two beloved pillars of the
valour of the Gaels, and the two keys of the bravery of the Gaels to
be brought to fight from afar through the instigation and intermeddling
of Oilioll and Mève.</p>

<p>"Each of them began to shoot at other with their missive weapons
from the dawn of early morning till the middle of midday. And
when midday came the ire of the men waxed more furious, and
each of them drew nearer to the other. And then it was that Cuchulain
on one occasion sprang from the brink of the ford and came on
the boss of the shield of Ferdiad, son of Daman, for the purpose of
striking his head over the rim of his shield from above. And it was
then that Ferdiad gave the shield a blow of his left elbow and cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Cuchulain from him like a bird on the brink of the ford. Cuchulain
sprang from the brink of the ford again till he came on the boss of
the shield of Ferdiad, son of Daman, for the purpose of striking his
head over the rim of the shield from above. Ferdiad gave the shield
a stroke of his left knee and cast Cuchulain from him like a little
child on the brink of the ford.</p>

<p>"Laeg [his charioteer] perceived that act. 'Alas, indeed,' said
Laeg, 'the warrior who is against thee casts thee away as a lewd
woman would cast her child. He throws thee as foam is thrown by
the river. He grinds thee as a mill would grind fresh malt. He
pierces thee as the felling axe would pierce the oak. He binds thee
as the woodbine binds the tree. He darts on thee as the hawk darts
on small birds, so that henceforth thou hast nor call nor right nor
claim to valour or bravery to the end of time and life, thou little
fairy phantom,' said Laeg.</p>

<p>"Then up sprang Cuchulain with the rapidity of the wind and with
the readiness of the swallow, and with the fierceness of the dragon
and the strength of the lion into the troubled clouds of the air the
third time, and he alighted on the boss of the shield of Ferdiad, son
of Daman to endeavour to strike his head over the rim of his shield
from above. And then it was the warrior gave the shield a shake,
and cast Cuchulain from him into the middle of the ford, the same
as if he had never been cast off at all.</p>

<p>"And it was then that Cuchulain's first distortion came on, and he
was filled with swelling and great fulness, like breath in a bladder,
until he became a terrible, fearful, many-coloured, wonderful Tuaig,
and he became as big as a Fomor, or a man of the sea, the great and
valiant champion, in perfect height over Ferdiad.<a name="FNanchor_18_474" id="FNanchor_18_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_474" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>"So close was the fight they made now that their heads met above
and their feet below and their arms in the middle over the rims and
bosses of their shields. So close was the fight they made that they
cleft and loosened their shields from their rims to their centres. So
close was the fight which they made that they turned and bent and
shivered their spears from their points to their hafts. Such was the
closeness of the fight which they made that the Bocanachs and
Bananachs, and wild people of the glens, and demons of the air
screamed from the rims of their shields and from the hilts of their
swords and from the hafts of their spears. Such was the closeness of
the fight which they made that they cast the river out of its bed and
out of its course, so that it might have been a reclining and reposing
couch for a king or for a queen in the middle of the ford, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
there was not a drop of water<a name="FNanchor_19_475" id="FNanchor_19_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_475" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in it unless it dropped into it by the
trampling and the hewing which the two champions and the two
heroes made in the middle of the ford. Such was the intensity of
the fight which they made that the stud of the Gaels darted away in
fright and shyness, with fury and madness, breaking their chains and
their yokes, their ropes and their traces, and that the women and
youths, and small people, and camp followers, and non-combatants of
the men of Erin broke out of the camp south-westwards.</p>

<p>"They were at the edge-feat of swords during the time. And it
was then that Ferdiad found an unguarded moment upon Cuchulain,
and he gave him a stroke of the straight-edged sword, and buried it
in his body until his blood fell into his girdle, until the ford became
reddened with the gore from the body of the battle-warrior.
Cuchulain would not endure this, for Ferdiad continued his
unguarded stout strokes, and his quick strokes and his tremendous
great blows at him. And he asked Laeg, son of Riangabhra, for the
Gae Bulg. The manner of that was this: it used to be set down the
stream and cast from between the toes [<i>lit.</i> in the cleft of the foot],
it made the wound of one spear in entering the body, but it had
thirty barbs to open, and could not be drawn out of a person's
body until it was cut open. And when Ferdiad heard the Gae Bulg
mentioned he made a stroke of the shield down to protect his lower
body. Cuchulain thrust the unerring thorny spear off the centre of
his palm over the rim of the shield, and through the breast of the
skin-protecting armour, so that its further half was visible after
piercing his heart in his body. Ferdiad gave a stroke of his shield
up to protect the upper part of his body, though it was 'the relief
after the danger.' The servant set the Gae Bulg down the stream
and Cuchulain caught it between the toes of his foot, and he threw
an unerring cast of it at Ferdiad till it passed through the firm deep
iron waistpiece of wrought iron and broke the great stone which
was as large as a millstone in three, and passed through the protections
of his body into him, so that every crevice and every cavity of
him was filled with its barbs.</p>

<p>"'That is enough now, indeed,' said Ferdiad, 'I fall of that.
Now indeed may I say that I am sickly after thee, and not by thy
hand should I have fallen,' and he said [<i>here follow some verses</i>]....</p>

<p>"Cuchulain ran towards him after that, and clasped his two arms
about him and lifted him with his arms and his armour and his
clothes across the ford northward, in order that the slain should lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
by the ford on the north, and not by the ford on the west with the
men of Erin.</p>

<p>"Cuchulain laid Ferdiad down there, and a trance and a faint and
a weakness fell then on Cuchulain over Ferdiad.</p>

<p>"'Good, O Cuchulain,' said Laeg, 'rise up now for the men of
Erin are coming upon us, and it is not single combat they will give
thee since Ferdiad, son of Daman, son of Dare, has fallen by thee.'</p>

<p>"'Servant,' said he, 'what availeth me to arise after him that hath
fallen by me.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Cuchulain is carried away swooning after this fight and is
brought by the two sons of Géadh to the streams and rivers to
be cured of his stabs and wounds, by plunging him in the
waters and facing him against the currents, "for the Tuatha
De Danann sent plants of grace and herbs of healing (floating)
down the streams and rivers of Muirtheimhne, to comfort and
help Cuchulain, so that the streams were speckled and green
overhead with them." The Finglas, the Bush, the Douglas,
and eighteen other rivers are mentioned as aiding to cure
him.</p>

<p>During the period of Cuchulain's leeching many events were
happening in Mève's camp, amongst others the tragic death of
her beautiful daughter, Finnabra.<a name="FNanchor_20_476" id="FNanchor_20_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_476" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Isolated bands of the men
of Ulster were now beginning to at last muster in front of
Mève, and amongst them came a certain northern chief, who
was, as her daughter secretly confessed to Mève, her own love
and sweetheart beyond all the men of Erin.</p>

<p>The prudent Mève immediately desires her to go to him, if
he is her lover, and do everything in her power to make him
draw off his warriors. This design, however, got abroad, and
came to the ears of the twelve Munster princes who led the
forces of the southern province in Mève's army. These
gradually make the discovery that the astute queen had
secretly promised her daughter's hand to each one of the
twelve, as an inducement to him to take part in her expedition.
Infuriated at being thus trifled with and at Mève's treachery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
in now sending her daughter to the Ultonian, they fall with
all their forces upon the queen's battalion and the whole camp
becomes a scene of blood and confusion. The warrior Fergus
at last succeeds in separating the combatants, not before seven
hundred men have fallen. But when Finnabra saw the
slaughter that was raging, of which she herself was cause,
"a blood-torrent burst from her heart in her bosom through
(mingled) shame and generosity," and she was taken up dead.</p>

<p>In the meantime Cuchulain is joined by another great
Ultonian warrior, who is also being leeched. He had fallen
upon the men of Erin single-handed, and received many
wounds, one from Mève herself, who fought, like Boadicea,
at the head of her troops. He describes the amazon who
wounded him to Cuchulain&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A largely-nurtured, white-faced, long-cheeked woman, with a
yellow mane on the top of her two shoulders, with a shirt of royal
silk over her white skin, and a speckled spear red-flaming in her
hand; it was she who gave me this wound, and I gave her another
small wound in exchange.</p>

<p>"'I know that woman,' said Cuchulain, 'that woman was Mève,
and it had been glory and exultation to her had you fallen by her
hand.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Afterwards Sualtach, father of Cuchulain, heard the groans
of his son as he was being cured, and said, "Is it heaven that
is bursting, or the sea that is retiring, or the land that is
loosening, or is it the groan of my son in his extremity that I
hear?" said he. Cuchulain despatches him to urge the
Ultonians to his assistance. "Tell them how you found me,"
he said; "there is not the place of the point of a needle in
me from head to foot without a wound, there is not a hair
upon my body without a dew of crimson blood upon the top
of every point, except my left hand alone that was holding my
shield."</p>

<p>And now the Ultonians begin to rally and face the men of
Erin. Troops are seen to pour in from every quarter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Ulster, gathering upon the plains of Meath for the great battle
that was impending. Mève sends out her trusted messenger
to bring word of what is going on amongst the hostile bands.
His first report is that the noise of the Ultonians hewing down
the woods before their chariots with the edge of their swords
was "like nothing but as it were the solid firmament falling
upon the surface-face of the earth, or as it were the sky-blue
sea pouring over the superficies of the plain, as it were the
earth being rent asunder, or the forests falling [each tree] into
the grasp and fork of the other."</p>

<p>Mac Roth, the chief messenger, is again sent out to observe
the gathering of the hosts and to bring word of what bands are
coming in to the hill where Conor, king of Ulster, has set up
his standard. On his return at nightfall there follows a long,
minute, and tedious account, something like the list of ships in
the Iliad, only broken by the questions of Mève and Oilioll,
and the answers of Fergus. It contains, however, some passages
of interest. The scout describes the arrival of twenty-nine
different armaments around their respective chiefs at the
hill where King Conor is encamping. Incidentally he gives
us descriptions of characters of interest in the Saga-cycle. As
he ends his description of each band and its leaders, Oilioll
turns to Fergus, and Fergus from Mac Roth's description
recognises and tells him who the various leaders are. In this
way we get a glimpse at Sencha, the wise man, the Nestor of
the Red Branch, whose counsel was ever good. "That man,"
said Fergus, "is the speaker and peace-maker of the host of
Ulster, and I pledge my word that it is no cowardly or
unheroic counsel which that man will give to his lord this day,
but counsel of vigour and valour and fight." We see the
arrival of Feirceirtné, the arch-ollav of the Ultonians, of
Cathbadh the Druid, he who had prophesied of Déirdre at her
birth, who was supposed, according to the earliest accounts, to
have been the real father of King Conor, he who weakened
the children of Usnach by his spells; and we see also Aithirne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the infamous and overbearing poet of the Ultonians, about
whom much is related in other tales. "The lakes and rivers,"
said Fergus, "recede before him when he satirises them, and
rise up before him when he praises them." "There are not
many men in life more handsome or more golden-locked than
he," said Mac Roth, "he bears a gleaming ivory[-hilted]
sword in his right hand." With this sword he amuses himself,
something like the Norman trouvère Taillefer at the battle
of Hastings, by casting it aloft and letting it fall almost on the
heads of his companions but without hurting them. The
arch-druid is described as having scattered whitish-grey hair,
and wearing a purple-blue mantle with a large gleaming
shield and bosses of red brass, and a long iron sword of foreign
look. Conor's leech, Finghin, led a band of physicians to the
field; "that man could tell," said Fergus, "what a person's
sickness is by looking at the smoke of the house in which he
is." Another hero whom we catch a glimpse of is the mighty
Conall Cearnach, the greatest champion of the north, whose
name was till lately a household word around Dunsevrick, he
who afterwards so bloodily avenged Cuchulain's death, "the
sea over seas, the bursting rock, the furious troubler of hosts,"
as Fergus calls him.</p>

<p>We also see the youth Erc, son of Cairbré Niafer the
High-king, who comes from Tara to assist his grandfather
King Conor. It is curious, however, that in this catalogue
of the Ultonians quite as much space is given to the description
of men whose names are now&mdash;so far, at least, as I know&mdash;unknown
to us, as to those who often and prominently figure
in our yet remaining stories.</p>

<p>At last the great battle of the Táin comes off, when the men
of Ulster meet the men of Ireland fairly and face to face.
Prodigies of valour are performed on both sides, and Fergus&mdash;who
after Cuchulain is certainly the hero of the Táin&mdash;seconded
by Oilioll, by Mève, by the Seven Mainès, and by
the sons of Magach, drives the Ultonians back on his side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
the battle three times. Conor, who is on the other flank,
perceives that the men of his far wing are being broken, and
loudly</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"he shouts to the Household of the Red Branch, 'hold ye the place
in the battle where I am, till I go find who it is who has thrice
inclined the battle against us on the north.'</p>

<p>"'We take that upon ourselves,' said they, 'for heaven is over us,
and earth is under us, and unless the firmament fall down upon the
wave-face of the earth, or the ocean encircle us, or the ground give
way under us, or the ridgy blue-bordered sea rise over the expanse<a name="FNanchor_21_477" id="FNanchor_21_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_477" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
of life, we shall give not one inch of ground before the men of Erin
till thou come to us again, or till we be slain.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Conor hastens northward and finds himself confronted by
the man he had so bitterly wronged, whose hand had lain
heavy on his province and himself, Fergus, who now comes
face to face with him after so many years. Tremendous are
the strokes of Fergus.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He smote his three enemy blows upon Conor's shield 'Eochain'
so that the shield screamed thrice upon him, and the three leading
waves of Erin answered it.</p>

<p>"'Who,' cries Fergus, 'holds his shield against me in this battle?'<a name="FNanchor_22_478" id="FNanchor_22_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_478" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>"'O Fergus,' cried Conor, 'one who is greater and younger and
handsomer, and more perfect than thyself is here, and whose father
and whose mother were better than thine; one who slew the three
great candles of the valour of the Gaels, the three prosperous sons
of Usnach, in spite of thy guarantee and thy protection, the man
who banished thee out of thy own land and country, the man who
made of it a dwelling-place for the deer and the roe and the foxes,
the man who never left thee as much as the breadth of thy foot of
territory in Ulster, the man who drove thee to the entertainment of
women,<a name="FNanchor_23_479" id="FNanchor_23_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_479" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and the man who will drive thee back this day in the
presence of the men of Erin, [I] Conor, son of Fachtna Fathach,
High-king of Ulster, and son of the High-king of Ireland."</p></blockquote>

<p>Despite this boasting he would certainly have been slain by
his great opponent had not one of his sons clasped his arms in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
supplication around Fergus's knees and conjured him not to
destroy Ulster, and Fergus, melted by these entreaties, consented
to remain passive if Conor retired to the other wing of
the battle, which he did.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mève had sent away the Dun Bull with
fifty heifers round him and eight men, to drive him to her
palace in Connacht, "so that whoever reached Cruachan
alive, or did not reach it, the Dun Bull of Cuailgne should
reach it as she had promised."</p>

<p>Cuchulain, who had joined the Ultonians, and whose arms
had been taken from him, lest in his enfeebled condition he
should injure himself by taking part in the fray, unable to
bear any longer the look of the battle, the shouting and the
war-cries, rushes into the fight with part of his broken chariot
for a weapon, and performs mighty feats. At length he ceases
to slay at Mève's solicitation, whose life he spares, and the
shattered remnants of her host begin slowly to withdraw
across the ford. "Oilioll draws his shield of protection behind
the host [<i>i.e.</i>, covers the rear], Mève draws her shield of
protection in her own place, Fergus draws his shield of protection,
the Mainès draw their shield of protection, the sons
of Magach draw their shield of protection behind the host;
and in this manner they brought with them the men of Erin
across the great ford westward," nor did they cease their retreat
till Mève and her army found themselves at Cruachan in
Connacht, whence they had set out.</p>

<p>The long saga ends with a decided anti-climax, the encounter
between the Dun Bull, whom Mève had carried off, and her
own bull, the White-Horned.<a name="FNanchor_24_480" id="FNanchor_24_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_480" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> These bulls, according to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
of the most curious of the short auxiliary sagas to the Táin,
were really rebirths of two men who hated each other during
life, and now fought it out in the form of bulls. When they
caught sight of each other they pawed the earth so furiously
that they sent the sods flying across their shoulders, "they
rolled the eyes in their heads like flames of fiery lightning."
All day long they charged, and thrust, and struggled, and
bellowed, while the men of Ireland looked on, "but when the
night came they could do nothing but be listening to the noises
and the sounds." The two bulls traversed much of Ireland
during that night.<a name="FNanchor_25_481" id="FNanchor_25_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_481" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Next morning the people of Cruachan
saw the Dun Bull coming with the remains of his enemy upon
his horns. The men of Connacht would have intercepted
him, but Fergus, ever generous, swore with a great oath that
all that had been done in the pursuit of the Táin was nothing
to what he would do if the Dun Bull were not allowed to
return to his own country with his kill. The Dun made
straight for his home at Cuailgne in Louth. He drank of the
Shannon at Athlone, and as he stooped one of his enemy's loins
fell off from his horn, hence Ath-luain, the Ford of the Loin.
After that he rushed, mad with passion, towards his home,
killing every one who crossed his way. Arrived there, he set
his back to a hill and uttered wild bellowings of triumph,
until "his heart in his breast burst, and he poured his heart in
black mountains of brown blood out across his mouth."</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h5>

<h4>THE DEATH OF CUCHULAIN</h4>


<p>Although Cuchulain won for himself in this war an imperishable
fame, yet he was not destined to enjoy it long, for he
perished before arriving at middle age.<a name="FNanchor_1_482" id="FNanchor_1_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_482" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The account of his
death is preserved in the Book of Leinster, a manuscript of
the middle of the twelfth century, which quotes incidentally
from an Irish poet<a name="FNanchor_2_483" id="FNanchor_2_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_483" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the seventh century, thus showing that
Cuchulain was at this early age the hero of the poets. Unfortunately
the opening of the story in the Book of Leinster
is lost, but many modern extensions of the saga still exist, from
one of which in my possession I shall supply what is missing.<a name="FNanchor_3_484" id="FNanchor_3_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_484" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Cuchulain had three formidable enemies, who were bent
upon his life, these were Lughaidh [Lewy] the son of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Momonian king Curigh,<a name="FNanchor_4_485" id="FNanchor_4_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_485" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> whom Cuchulain had slain, Erc, the
son of Cairbré Niafer king of all Ireland, who was slain in
the battle of Rosnaree,<a name="FNanchor_5_486" id="FNanchor_5_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_486" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and the descendants of the wizard
Calatin, who with his twenty sons and his son-in-law fell by
Cuchulain in one of the combats at the Ford, during the raid of
the Táin. His wife, however, brought into the world three
posthumous children, daughters.<a name="FNanchor_6_487" id="FNanchor_6_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_487" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> These unhappy creatures
Mève mutilated by cutting off their right legs and left arms,
so that they might be odious and horrible, and all the fitter
for the dread profession she proposed for them&mdash;evil wizardry.
She reared them carefully, and so soon as they were of a
fitting age she sent them into the world to gain a knowledge
of charms and spells, and druidism, and witchcraft, and incantations.
In pursuit of this knowledge they roamed throughout
the world, and at last returned to the queen as perfect adepts
as might be.</p>

<p>Thereupon she convened a second muster of the men of the
four provinces, and joined by Lewy the son of Curigh, and
Erc the son of Cairbré Niafer, both of whose parents had
fallen by Cuchulain, and having with her the odious but
powerful children of Calatin, eager to avenge the death of
their father and their family, she again marched upon Ulster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
during the sickness of their warriors, and began to plunder
and to burn and to drive away a mighty prey. King Conor
immediately surmised that it was against Cuchulain the
expedition was prepared, and without a moment's delay he
depatched Lavarcam his female messenger, to desire him
instantly to leave his palace and his patrimony at Dundealgan<a name="FNanchor_7_488" id="FNanchor_7_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_488" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
in the plain of Muirtheimhne, and come to himself at Emania,
there to be under the King's immediate orders. This command
he gave, thinking to rescue Cuchulain from the possible effects
of his own valour and rashness, for there was scarcely a man
of distinction in any of the four provinces of Erin some of
whose relatives had not been slain by him.</p>

<p>Lavarcam found the hero upon the shore, between sea and
land, intent upon the slaying of sea-fowl with his sling, but
though birds many flew over him and past him, not one could
he bring down&mdash;they all escaped him. And this was to him
the first bad omen. Very reluctantly did he obey the call of
Conor, and sorely loath was he to leave his patrimony. He
accompanied Lavarcam, however, to Emania, and abode there
in his own bright-lighted crystal <i>grianán</i>. Then Conor consulted
with his druids as to how best to keep him there, and
they sent the bright ladies of Emania, and his wife Emer, and
the poets and the musicians, and the men of science, to surround
and distract and amuse him, with conversation and
music and banquets.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, Mève's army had advanced upon
and burned Dundealgan, and the children of Calatin had
promised that within three days and three nights they would
bring Cuchulain to his doom.</p>

<p>And now ensues what is to my mind one of the most
powerful incidents in all this saga&mdash;the malignant ghoulish
efforts of the children of Calatin to draw forth Cuchulain
from his place of safety, and on the other side the anxiety of
the druids and ladies, and the frenzied heart-sick efforts of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
wife, and his mistress, to detain him. The loathsome wizards
flew through the air and stationed themselves upon the plain
outside Emania&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They smote the soil and beat and tore it up around them, so that
they made of fuz-balls, and of stalks of <i>sanna</i>, and of the fine foliage
of the oaks, as it were ordered battalions, and hosts, and multitudes
of men, and the confused shoutings of the battalions and of the war-bands,
and the battle array, were heard on all sides, as it were
striking and attacking the fortress."</p></blockquote>

<p>Geanan the druid, the son of old Cathbadh, was watching
Cuchulain this day. As soon as the sounds of war and shouting
reached him Cuchulain rose and "looked forth, and he saw
the battalions smiting each other unsparingly," as he thought,
and he burned at once with fury and shame; but the druid
cast his two arms round him in time to prevent him from
bursting forth to relieve the apparently foe-beleaguered town.
Over and over again must the druid assure him that all he saw
was blind-work and magic, and unreal phantoms, employed by
the clan Calatin to lure him forth to his destruction.<a name="FNanchor_8_489" id="FNanchor_8_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_489" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It was
impossible, however, to keep Cuchulain from at least looking,
and, the next time he looked forth,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"he thought he beheld the battalions drawn up upon the plains,
and the next time he looked after that he thought he saw Gradh
son of Lir upon the plain, and it was a <i>geis</i> (tabu) to him to see that,
and then he thought moreover that he heard the harp of the son of
Mangur playing musically, ever-sweetly, and it was a <i>geis</i> to him to
listen to those pleasing fairy sounds, and he recognised from these
things that his virtue was indeed overcome, and that his <i>geasa</i>
(tabus) were broken, and that the end of his career had arrived,
and that his valour and prowess were destroyed by the children of
Calatin."</p></blockquote>

<p>After that one of the daughters of the wizard Calatin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
assuming the form of a crow, came flying over him and
incited him with taunts to go and rescue his homestead and
his patrimony from the hands of his enemies. And although
Cuchulain now understood that these were enchantments that
were working against him, yet was he none the less anxious
to rush forth and oppose them, for he felt moved and troubled
in himself at the shouting of the imaginary hosts, and his
memory, and his senses, and his right mind were afflicted by
the sounds of that ever-thrilling harp.</p>

<p>Then the druid used all his influence, explaining to him
that if he would only remain for three days more in Emania
the spells would have no power, and he would go forth again,
"and the whole world would be full of his victories and his
lasting renown," and thereafter the ladies of Emania and the
musicians closed round him, and they sang sweet melodies,
and they distracted his mind, and the day drew to a close:&mdash;the
clan Calatin retired baffled, and Cuchulain was himself
once more.</p>

<p>During that night the ladies and the druids took council
together and determined to carry him away to a glen so remote
and lonely that it was called the Deaf Valley, and to hide him
there, preparing for him a splendid banquet, with music, and
poets, and delights of every kind.</p>

<p>Next morning came the accursed wizards and inspected the
city, and they marvelled that they saw not Cuchulain, and
that he was neither beside his wife, nor yet amongst the other
heroes of the Red Branch. Then they understood that he
had been hidden away by Cathbadh the druid, "and they
raised themselves aloft, lightly and airily, upon a blast of
enchanted wind, which they created to lift them," and went
soaring over the entire province of Ulster to discover his
retreat. This they do by perceiving Cuchulain's grey steed,
the Liath Macha, standing outside at the entrance to the
glen. Then the three begin their wizardry anew, and made,
as it were, battalions of warriors to appear round the glen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
and they raised anew the sounds of arms and the shouts of war
and conflict, as they had done at Emania.</p>

<p>The instant the ladies round Cuchulain heard it they also
shouted, and the musicians struck up&mdash;but in vain; Cuchulain
had caught the sound. They succeeded, however, in calming
his mind, and in inducing him to pay no heed to the false
witcheries of the clan Calatin. These continued for a long
time waiting and filling the air with their unreal battle tumult,
but Cuchulain did not appear. Then they understood that
the druids had been more powerful than they. Mad with
impotent fury one of them enters the glen, and pushes her way
right into the very fortress where Cuchulain was feasting.
Once there she changes herself into the form of the beautiful
Niamh [Nee-av], Cuchulain's love and sweetheart. First she
stood at the door in the likeness of an attendant damsel, and
beckoned to the lady to come to her outside. Niamh, thinking
she has something to communicate, follows her through
the door and out into the valley, and the other ladies follow
Niamh. Instantly she raises an enchanted fog between them
and the dún, so that they wander astray, and their minds are
troubled. But she, assuming the form of the lady Niamh herself,
slips back into the fortress, comes to Cuchulain, and cries
to him: "Up, O Cuchulain, and meet the men of Erin, or
thy fame shall be lost for ever, and the province shall be
destroyed." At this speech Cuchulain is astounded, for Niamh
had bound him by an oath that he would not go forth or take
arms until she herself should give him leave, and this leave he
never thought to receive of her until the fatal time was over.
"I shall go," said Cuchulain, "and that is a pity, O Niamh,"
said he, "and after that it is difficult to trust to woman, for
I had thought thou hadst not given me that leave for the gold
of the world, but since it is thou who dost let me go to face
the men of Erin, I shall go." After that he rose and left the
dún. "I have no reason for preserving my life longer," said
Cuchulain, "for the end of my time is come, and all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
<i>geasa</i> (tabus) are lost, and Niamh has let me go to face the
men of Erin; and since she has let me, I shall go."</p>

<p>Afterwards the real Niamh overtakes him at the entrance to
the glen, and assured him with torrents of tears, and wild sobs,
that it was not she who had given him leave, but the vile
enchantress who had assumed her form, and she conjured him
with prayers and piteous entreaties to remain with her. But
Cuchulain would not believe her, and urged Laeg to catch his
steeds and yoke them, for he thought that he beheld&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The great battle-battalions ranged upon the green of Emania,
and the whole plain filled up and crowded with broad bands of
hundreds of men, with champions, and steeds, and arms, and
armour, and he thought he heard the awful shoutings, and [saw]
the burnings extending, widely-let-loose through the buildings
of Conor's city, and him-seemed that there was nor hill nor
rising ground about Emania that was not full of spoils, and it
appeared to him that Emer's sunny-house was overthrown and had
fallen out over the ramparts of Emania, and that the House of the
Red Branch was in one blaze, and that all Emania was one meeting-place
of fire, and of black, dark, spacious, brown-red smoke."<a name="FNanchor_9_490" id="FNanchor_9_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_490" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Then Cuchulain's brooch fell from his hand and pierced his
foot, another omen of ill. Nor would his noble grey war-horse
allow himself to be caught. It was only when Cuchulain
addressed him with persuasive words of verse that he consented
to let himself be harnessed to the chariot, and even then "he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
lets fall upon his fore feet, from his eyes, two large tears of
blood." In vain did the ladies of Emania try to bar his
passage, in vain did fifty queens uncover their bosoms before
him in supplication. "He is the first," says the saga, "of
whom it is recounted that women uncovered before him their
bosoms."<a name="FNanchor_10_491" id="FNanchor_10_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_491" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Thereafter another evil omen overtook him, for as he pursued
the high road leading to the south,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"and had passed the plain of Mogna, he perceived something, three
hags of the half-blind race,<a name="FNanchor_11_492" id="FNanchor_11_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_492" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> who were on the track before him cooking
a poisoned dog's flesh upon spits of holly. Now it was a <i>geis</i>
(tabu) to Cuchulain to pass a cooking-fire without visiting it and
accepting food. It was another <i>geis</i> to eat of his own name" [<i>i.e.</i>, a
hound, he is Cu-Chulain or Culan's hound], "so he pauses not, but
passes the three hags. Then one of them cries to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Come, visit us, Cuchulain.'</p>

<p>"'I shall not visit you,' said Cuchulain.</p>

<p>"'There is something to eat here,' replied the hag; 'we have a
dog to offer thee. If our cooking-place were great,' said she, 'thou
wouldst come, but because it is small thou comest not; a great man
who despises the small, deserves no honour.'</p>

<p>"Cuchulain then moved over to the hag, and she with her left
hand offered him half the dog. Cuchulain ate, and it was with his
left hand he took the piece, and he placed part of it under his left
thigh, and his left hand and his left thigh were cursed, and the curse
reached all his left side, which from his head to his feet lost a great
part of its power."</p></blockquote>

<p>At last Cuchulain meets the enemy on his ancestral patrimony
of Moy Muirtheimhne, drawn up in battle array, with
shield to shield as though it were one solid plank that was
around them. Cuchulain displays his feats from his chariot,
especially "his three thunder-feats&mdash;the thunder of an hundred,
the thunder of three hundred, the thunder of thrice nine
men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He played equally with spear, shield, and sword, he performed
all the feats of a warrior. As many as there are of grains of sand in
the sea, of stars in the heaven, of dewdrops in May, of snowflakes
in winter, of hailstones in a storm, of leaves in a forest, of ears of corn
in the plains of Bregia, of sods beneath the feet of the steeds of Erin
on a summer's day, so many halves of heads, and halves of shields, and
halves of hands and halves of feet, so many red bones were scattered
by him throughout the plain of Muirtheimhne, it became grey with
the brains of his enemies, so fierce and furious was Cuchulain's
onslaught."</p></blockquote>

<p>The plan which Erc, son of the late High-king Cairbré
Niafer had adopted was to place two men pretending to fight
with one another upon each flank of the army and a druid
standing near who should first make Cuchulain separate the
combatants, and should then demand from him his spear, since
there ran a prophecy to the effect that Cuchulain's spear should
kill a king, but if they could get the spear from him they at
least would be safe from the prophecy; it would not be one of
them who should be slain by it.</p>

<p>Cuchulain separates the fighters as the druid asks him, by
killing each of them with a blow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'You have separated them,' said the druid, 'they shall do each
other no more harm.'</p>

<p>"'They would not be so silenced,' said Cuchulain, 'hadst thou not
prayed me to interfere between them.'</p>

<p>"'Give me thy spear, O Cuchulain,' said the druid.</p>

<p>"'I swear by the oath which my nation swears,' said Cuchulain,
'you have no greater need of the spear than I. All the warriors
of Erin are come together against me, and I must defend myself.'</p>

<p>"'If thou refuse me,' said the druid, 'I shall solemnly utter against
thee a magic curse.'</p>

<p>"'Up to this time,' replied Cuchulain, 'no curse has ever been
levelled against me for any act of refusal on my part.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>And with that he reversed his spear and threw it at the druid
butt foremost, killing him and nine more. Lewy, the son of
Curigh, immediately picked it up.</p>

<p>"'Whom,' said he to the children of Calatin, 'is this to
overthrow?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It is a king whom that spear shall slay,' said they.</p>

<p>"Lewy hurled it at Cuchulain's chariot, and it pierced Laeg,
his charioteer.</p>

<p>"Cuchulain bade his charioteer farewell.</p>

<p>"'To-day,' said Cuchulain, 'I shall be both warrior and
charioteer.'"</p>

<p>The same incident happens again. Cuchulain kills the second
druid in the same way, and his spear is picked up by Erc.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Children of Calatin,' said Erc, 'what exploit shall this spear
perform?'</p>

<p>"'It shall overthrow a king,' said they.</p>

<p>"'You said this spear would overthrow a king when Lewy hurled
it some time ago,' said Erc.</p>

<p>"'Nor were we deceived,' said they, 'that spear has brought down
the king of the charioteers of Ireland, Laeg, the son of Riangabhra,
Cuchulain's charioteer.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Erc hurls the spear and it passes through the side of Cuchulain's
noble steed, the Liath Macha. Cuchulain took a fond
farewell of the animal who galloped with half the yoke around
its neck to the lake from whence he had first taken it, on the
mountain of Fuad in far-off Armagh.</p>

<p>The third time a druid demands his spear, and is killed by
Cuchulain, who throws it to him handle foremost. The spear
is picked up this time by Lewy son of Curigh.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'What feat shall this spear perform, ye children of Calatin?'
said Lewy.</p>

<p>"It shall overthrow a king,' said they.</p>

<p>"'Ye said as much when Erc hurled it this morning,' answered
Lewy.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' answered the children of Calatin, 'and our word was true.
The spear which Erc hurled has wounded mortally the king of the
steeds of Ireland, the Liath Macha.'</p>

<p>"'I swear then,' said Lewy, 'by the oath which my nation swears,
that Erc's blow smote not the king which this spear is to slay.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Then Lewy hurls the spear, and this time pierces Cuchulain
through the body, and Cuchulain's other steed burst the yoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
and rushed off and never ceased till he, too, had plunged into the
lake from which Cuchulain had taken him in far-off Munster.<a name="FNanchor_12_493" id="FNanchor_12_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_493" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Cuchulain remained behind, dying in his chariot. With difficulty
and holding in his entrails with one hand, he advanced to a
little lake hard by, and drank from it, and washed off his blood.
Then he propped himself against a high stone a few yards from
the lake, and tied himself to it with his girdle. "He did not
wish to die either sitting or lying, it was standing," says the
saga, "that he wished to meet death."</p>

<p>But his grey steed, the Liath Macha,<a name="FNanchor_13_494" id="FNanchor_13_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_494" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> returned once more to
defend his lord, and made three terrible charges, scattering with
tooth and hoof all who would approach the stone where Cuchulain
was dying. At last a bird was seen to alight upon his
shoulder. "Yon pillar used not to be a settling place for birds,"
said Erc. They knew then that he was dead. Lewy, the son
of Curigh, seized him by the back hair and severed his head
from his body.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But Cuchulain was too important an epic hero to thus finish
with him. Another very celebrated, but probably later épopée
tells of how his friend Conall Cearnach pursued the retreating
army and exacted vengeance for his death. A brief digest of
Conall's revenge is contained in the Book of Leinster, but modern
copies of much longer and more literary versions exist, and there
was no more celebrated poem amongst the later Gael than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
called the Lay of the Heads in which Conall Cearnach returns to
Emer, Cuchulain's wife, to Emania, with a large bundle of heads
strung upon a gad, or withy-wand, thrust through their mouths
from cheek to cheek, and there explains in a lay to Emer who
they were.</p>

<p>In the ancient version in the Book of Leinster it is only
Lewy who is slain by Conall. In my more modern recension
he slays Erc and the children of Calatin as well, and recovers
the head of Cuchulain, which he found being used as a football
by two men near Tara. "If this city," said he of Tara,
"were Erc's own lordship and patrimony I would burn it
down, but since it is the very navel and meeting-point of the
men of Ireland, I shall affront it no more."</p>

<p>Emer's joy and her grief on recovering her husband's head are
touchingly described.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"She washed clean the head and she joined it on to its body, and
she pressed it to her heart and her bosom, and fell to lamenting and
heavily sorrowing over it, and began to suck in its blood and to drink
it,<a name="FNanchor_14_495" id="FNanchor_14_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_495" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and she placed around the head a lovely satin cloth. 'Ochone!'
said she, 'good was the beauty of this head, although it is low this
day, and it is many of the kings and princes of the world would be
keening it if they thought it was like this; and the men who demand
gold and treasure, and ask petitions of the men of Erin and Alba
[<i>i.e.</i>, the poets and druids] thou wast their one love and their one
choice of the men of the earth, and woe for me that I remain behind
this day; for there was not of the women of Erin, nor in the whole
great world, a woman mated with a husband, or unmated, not a single
one, who, until this day, was not envious of me; for many were the
goods and jewels and rents and tributes from the countries of the world
that thou broughtest to me, with the valour and strength of thy
hand,' and she took his hand in hers and fell to making lamentations
over it, and to telling of its fame and its exploits, and 't was what
she said, 'Alas!' said she, 'it is many of the kings and of the chieftains
and of the strong men of the world that fell by this hand, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
many of the goods and treasures of this world that were scattered
by it upon poets and men of knowledge,' and she spake the lay,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'Ochone O head, Ochone O head,'" etc.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Afterwards Conall Cearnach arrives with his pile of heads
and planted them carefully "all round about the wide grass-green
lawn" upon pointed sticks, and relates to Emer who they
were and how they fell.<a name="FNanchor_15_496" id="FNanchor_15_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_496" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>"Thereafter," says the saga, "Emer desired Conall to make
a wide very deep tomb for Cuchulain," and she laid herself
down in it along with her gentle mate, and she set her mouth
to his mouth, and she spake&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Love of my soul,' she said, 'O friend, O gentle sweetheart, and
O thou one choice of the men of the earth, many is the woman
envied me thee until now, and I shall not live after thee;' and her
soul departed out of her, and she herself and Cuchulain were laid in
the one grave by Conall, and he raised their stone over their tomb,
and he wrote their names in Ogam, and their funeral games were
performed by him and by the Ultonians.</p>

From this out, however, the version in the twelfth-century Book of Leinster
is used. Monsieur d'Arbois de Jubainville, in his introduction to the fragment
of the saga in the Book of Leinster, seems to think that Emania was really
besieged, and women and children slaughtered round its walls by the
men of Erin, whereas it would appear that the lost part of the saga refers
to some such version as I have given from my manuscript, and that it was
only the wizardry and sorcery of the children of Calatin, who raised these
phantasms. This is the more evident because Cuchulain, when he issues
forth, meets no enemy until he has arrived at the plain of Muirtheimhne.
Jubainville's words are, "Cependant les cris de douleur des femmes et
des enfants qu'on massacrait jusqu'au pied des remparts d'Emain macha
[Emania] parvinrent à son oreille: on en verra un peu plus bas les conséquences,
dont la dernière fut la mort du heros."</p></div>

<h4>OTHER SAGAS OF THE RED BRANCH</h4>


<p>Another saga belonging to this cycle affords so curious a
picture of pagan customs that it is worth while to give here
some extracts from it. This is the story of Mac Dáthó's Pig
and Hound, which is contained in the Book of Leinster, a
MS. copied about the year 1150. It was first published without
a translation by Windisch in his "Irische Texte," from the
Book of Leinster copy collated with two others. It has since
been translated by Kuno Meyer from a fifteenth-century
vellum.<a name="FNanchor_1_497" id="FNanchor_1_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_497" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The story runs as follows.</p>

<p>Mac Dáthó was a famous landholder in Leinster, and he
possessed a hound so extraordinarily strong and swift that it
could run round Leinster in a day. All Ireland was full of
the fame of that hound, and every one desired to have it. It
struck Mève and Oilioll, king and queen of Connacht, to
send an embassy to Mac Dáthó to ask him for his hound, at
the same time that the notion came to Conor, king of Ulster,
that he also would like to possess it. Two embassies reach
Mac Dáthó's house at the same time, the one from Connacht
and the other from Ulster, and both ask for the hound for their
respective masters. Mac Dáthó's house was one of those open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
hostelries<a name="FNanchor_2_498" id="FNanchor_2_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_498" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of which there were five at that time in Ireland.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Seven doors," says the saga, "there were in each hostelry, seven
roads through it, and seven fireplaces therein. Seven caldrons in
the seven fireplaces. An ox and a salted pig would go into each of
these caldrons, and the man that came along the road would (<i>i.e.</i>,
any traveller who passed the way was entitled to) thrust the flesh
fork into the caldron, and whatever he brought up with the first
thrust, that he would eat, and if nothing were brought up with the
first thrust there was no other for him."</p></blockquote>

<p>The messengers are brought before Mac Dáthó to his bed,
and questioned as to the cause of their coming.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'To ask for the hound are we come,' said the messengers of
Connacht, 'from Oilioll and from Mève, and in exchange for it there
shall be given three score hundred milch cows at once, and a chariot
with the two horses that are best in Connacht under it, and as much
again at the end of the year besides all that.'</p>

<p>"'We, too, have come to ask for it,' said the messengers of Ulster,
'and Conor is no worse a friend than Oilioll and Mève, and the same
amount shall be given from the north (<i>i.e.</i>, from the Ultonians) and
be added to, and there will be good friendship from it continually.'</p>

<p>"Mac Dáthó fell into a great silence, and was three days and
nights without sleeping, nor could he eat food for the greatness
of his trouble, but was moving about from one side to another. It
was then his wife addressed him and said, 'Long is the fast in
which thou art,' said she; 'there is plenty of food by thee, though
thou dost not eat it.'</p>

<p>"And then she said&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'Sleeplessness was brought</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Mac Dáthó into his house.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was something on which he deliberated</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though he speaks to none.<a name="FNanchor_3_499" id="FNanchor_3_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_499" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He turns away from me to the wall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Hero of the Féne of fierce valour,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His prudent wife observes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That her mate is without sleep.'"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>A dialogue in verse follows. The wife advises her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
to promise the hound to both sets of messengers. In his
perplexity he weakly decides to do this. After the messengers
had stayed with him for three nights and days, feasting, he
called to him first the envoys of Connacht and said to them&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I was in great doubt and perplexity, and this is what is grown
out of it, that I have given the hound to Oilioll and Mève, and let
them come for it splendidly and proudly, with as many warriors
and nobles as they can get, and they shall have drink and food and
many gifts besides, and shall take the hound and be welcome.'</p>

<p>"He also went with the messengers of Ulster and said to them,
'After much doubting I have given the hound to Conor, and let him
and the flower of the province come for it proudly, and they shall
have many other gifts and you shall be welcome.' But for one and
the same day he made his tryst with them all."</p></blockquote>

<p>Accordingly on the appointed day the warriors and men of
each province arrive at his hostelry in great state and pomp.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He himself went to meet them and bade them welcome. ''Tis
welcome ye are, O warriors,' said he, 'come within into the close.'</p>

<p>"Then they went over, and into the hostelry; one half of the
house for the men of Connacht and the other half for the men of
Ulster. That house was not a small one. Seven doors in it and
fifty beds between (every) two doors. Those were not faces of
friends at a feast, the people who were in that house, for many of
them had injured other. For three hundred years before the
birth of Christ there had been war between them.<a name="FNanchor_4_500" id="FNanchor_4_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_500" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>"'Let the pig be killed for them,' said Mac Dáthó."</p></blockquote>

<p>This celebrated pig had been fed for seven years on the
milk of three score milch cows, and it was so huge that it took
sixty men to draw it when slain. Its tail alone was a load for
nine men.</p>

<p>"'The pig is good,'" said Conor, king of Ulster.</p>

<p>"'It is good,'" said Oilioll, king of Connacht.</p>

<p>Then there arose a difficulty about the dividing of the pig.
As in the case of the "heroes' bit" the best warrior was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
divide it. King Oilioll asked King Conor what they should
do about it, when suddenly the mischievous, ill-minded Bricriu
spoke from a chamber overhead and asked, "How should it
be divided except by a contest of arms seeing that all the
valorous warriors of Connacht were there."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Let it be so,' said Oilioll.</p>

<p>"'We like it well,' said Conor, 'for we have lads in the house
who have many a time gone round the border.'</p>

<p>"'There will be need of thy lads to-night, O Conor,' said a famous
old warrior from Cruachna Conalath in the west. 'The roads of
Luachra Dedad have often had their backs turned to them (as they
fled). Many, too, the fat beeves they left with me.'</p>

<p>"''Twas a fat beef thou leftest with me,' said Munremar
mac Gerrcind, 'even thine own brother, Cruithne mac Ruaidlinde
from Cruachna Conalath of Connacht.'</p>

<p>"'He was no better,' said Lewy mac Conroi, 'than Irloth, son of
Fergus, son of Leite, who was left dead by Echbél, son of Dedad,
at Tara Luachra.'</p>

<p>"'What sort of man do ye think,' said Celtchair mac Uthechair,
'was Conganchnes, son of (that same) Dedad, who was slain by
myself, and me to strike the head off him?'</p>

<p>"Each of them brought up his exploits in the face of the other,
till at last it came to one man who beat every one, even Cet
mac Mágach of Connacht.<a name="FNanchor_5_501" id="FNanchor_5_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_501" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"He raised his prowess over the host, and took his knife in his
hand, and sat down by the pig. 'Now let there be found,' said he,
'among the men of Ireland one man to abide contest with me, or
let me divide the pig.'</p>

<p>"There was not at that time found a warrior of Ulster to stand up
to him, and great silence fell upon them.</p>

<p>"'Stop that for me, O Laeghaire [Leary],' said Conor, [King of
Ulster, <i>i.e.</i>, 'Delay, if you can, Cet's dividing the pig'].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>"Said Leary, 'It shall not be&mdash;Cet to divide the pig before the
face of us all!'</p>

<p>"'Wait a little, Leary,' said Cet, 'that thou mayest speak with
me. For it is a custom with you men of Ulster that every youth
among you who takes arms makes us his first goal.<a name="FNanchor_6_502" id="FNanchor_6_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_502" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Thou, too,
didst come to the border, and thus leftest charioteer and chariot
and horses with me, and thou didst then escape with a lance
through thee. Thou shalt not get at the pig in that manner!'</p>

<p>"Leary sat down upon his couch.</p>

<p>"'It shall not be,' said a tall, fair warrior of Ulster, coming out of
his chamber above, 'that Cet divide the pig.'</p>

<p>"'Who is this?' said Cet.</p>

<p>"'A better warrior than thou,' say all, 'even Angus, son of Hand-wail
of Ulster.'</p>

<p>"'Why is his father called Hand-wail?' said Cet.</p>

<p>"'We know not indeed,' say all.</p>

<p>"'But I know,' said Cet; 'once I went eastward (<i>i.e.</i>, crossed the
border into Ulster), an alarm-cry is raised around me, and Hand-wail
came up with me, like every one else. He makes a cast of a
large lance at me. I make a cast at him with the same lance, which
struck off his hand, so that it was (<i>i.e.</i>, fell) on the field before him.
What brings the son of that man to stand up to me?' said Cet.</p>

<p>"Then Angus goes to his couch.</p>

<p>"'Still keep up the contest,' said Cet, 'or let me divide the
pig.'</p>

<p>"'It is not right that thou divide it, O Cet,' said another tall, fair
warrior of Ulster.</p>

<p>"'Who is this?' said Cet.</p>

<p>"'Owen Mór, son of Durthacht,' say all, 'king of Fernmag.'<a name="FNanchor_7_503" id="FNanchor_7_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_503" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"'I have seen him before,' said Cet.</p>

<p>"'Where hast thou seen me,' said Owen.</p>

<p>"'In front of thine own house when I took a drove of cattle from
thee; the alarm cry was raised in the land around me, and thou
didst meet me and didst cast a spear at me, so that it stood out of
my shield. I cast the same spear at thee, which passed through thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
head and struck thine eye out of thy head, and the men of Ireland
see thee with one eye ever since.'</p>

<p>"He sat down in his seat after that.</p>

<p>"'Still keep up the contest, men of Ulster,' said Cet, 'or let me
divide the pig.'</p>

<p>"'Thou shalt not divide it,' said Munremar, son of Gerrcend.</p>

<p>"'Is that Munremar?' said Cet.</p>

<p>"'It is he,' say the men of Ireland.</p>

<p>"'It was I who last cleaned my hands in thee, O Munremar,'
said Cet; 'it is not three days yet since out of thine own land I
carried off three warriors' heads from thee, together with the head
of thy first son.'</p>

<p>"Munremar sat down on his seat.</p>

<p>"'Still the contest,' said Cet,' or I shall divide the pig.'</p>

<p>"'Verily thou shalt have it,' said a tall, grey, very terrible warrior
of the men of Ulster.</p>

<p>"'Who is this?' said Cet.</p>

<p>"'That is Celtchair, son of Uithechar,' say all.</p>

<p>"'Wait a little, Celtchair,' said Cet, 'unless thou comest to strike
me. I came, O Celtchair, to the front of thy house. The alarm was
raised around me. Every one went after me. Thou comest like
every one else, and going into a gap before me didst throw a spear
at me. I threw another spear at thee, which went through thy
loins, nor has either son or daughter been born to thee since."</p>

<p>"After that Celtchair sat down on his seat.</p>

<p>"'Still the contest,' said Cet, 'or I shall divide the pig.'</p>

<p>"'Thou shalt have it,' said Mend, son of Sword-heel.</p>

<p>"'Who is this?' said Cet.</p>

<p>"'Mend,' say all.</p>

<p>"'What! deem you,' said Cet, 'that the sons of churls with
nicknames should come to contend with me? for it was I was the
priest,<a name="FNanchor_8_504" id="FNanchor_8_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_504" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who christened thy father by that name, since it is I that
cut off his heel, so that he carried but one heel away with him.
What should bring the son of that man to contend with me?'</p>

<p>"Mend sat down in his seat.</p>

<p>"'Still the contest,' said Cet, 'or I shall divide the pig.'</p>

<p>"'Thou shalt have it,' said Cumscraidh, the stammerer of Macha,
son of Conor.</p>

<p>"'Who is this?'</p>

<p>"'That is Cumscraidh,' say all.</p>

<p>"He is the makings of a king, so far as his figure goes....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Well,' said Cet, 'thou madest thy first raid on us. We met on
the border. Thou didst leave a third of thy people with me, and
camest away with a spear through thy throat, so that no word comes
rightly over thy lips, since the sinews of thy throat were wounded,
so that Cumscraidh, the stammerer of Macha, is thy name ever since.'</p>

<p>"In that way he laid disgrace and a blow on the whole province.</p>

<p>"While he made ready with the pig and had his knife in his
hand, they see Conall <i>Ceârnach</i> [the Victorious], coming towards
them into the house. He sprang on to the floor of the house.
The men of Ulster gave him great welcome. 'Twas then [King]
Conor threw his helmet from his head and shook himself [for
joy] in his own place. 'We are glad,' said Conall, 'that our
portion is ready for us, and who divides for you?' said Conall.</p>

<p>"One man of the men of Ireland has obtained by contest the
dividing of it, to wit, Cet mac Mágach.</p>

<p>"'Is that true, Cet?' said Conall, 'art thou dividing the pig?'"</p></blockquote>

<p>There follows here an obscure dialogue in verse between
the warriors.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Get up from the pig, Cet,' said Conall.</p>

<p>"'What brings thee to it?' said Cet.</p>

<p>"'Truly [for you] to seek contest from me,' said Conall, 'and I
shall give you contest; I swear what my people swear since I
[first] took spear and weapons, I have never been a day without
having slain a Connachtman, nor a night without plundering, nor
have I ever slept without the head of a Connachtman under my
knee.'</p>

<p>"'It is true,' said Cet, 'thou art even a better warrior than I, but if
Anluan mac Mágach [my brother] were in the house,' said Cet, 'he
would match thee contest for contest, and it is a pity that he is not
in the house this night.'</p>

<p>"'Aye, is he, though,' said Conall, taking the head of Anluan from
his belt and throwing it at Cet's chest, so that a gush of blood broke
over his lips. After that Conall sat down by the pig and Cet went
from it.</p>

<p>"'Now let them come to the contest,' said Conall.</p>

<p>"Truly there was not then found among the men of Connacht a
warrior to stand up to him in contest, for they were loath to be slain
on the spot. The men of Ulster made a cover around him with
their shields, for there was an evil custom in the house, the people
of one side throwing stones at the other side. Then Conall proceeded
to divide the pig, and he took the end of the tail in his
mouth until he had finished dividing the pig."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>The men of Connacht, as might be expected, were not
pleased with their share. The rest of the piece recounts the
battle that ensued both in the hostelry, whence "seven streams
of blood burst through its seven doors," and outside in the
close or <i>liss</i> after the hosts had burst through the doors, the
death of the hound, the flight of Oilioll and Mève into
Connacht, and the curious adventures of their charioteer.</p>

of which, after nine years, he died. He was eventually slain by Conall
Cearnach as he was returning in a heavy fall of snow from a plundering
excursion in Ulster, carrying three heads with him. See O'Mahony's
Keating, p. 274, and Conall Cearnach was taken up for dead and brought

<h4>THE FENIAN CYCLE</h4>


<p>Cuchulain's life and love and death entranced the ears of
the great for many centuries, and into hundreds of bright eyes
tears of pity had for a thousand years been conjured up by the
pathetic tones of bards reciting the fate of her who perished
for the son of Usnach. The wars of Mève and of Conor
mac Nessa were household words in the hall of Muirchertach
of the leather cloaks, and in the palace at the head of the weir&mdash;Brian
Boru's Kincora. Whosoever loved what was great
in conception, and admired the broad sweep of the epic called
upon his bards to recite the loves, the wars, the valour, and
the deaths of the Red Branch knights.<a name="FNanchor_1_523" id="FNanchor_1_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_523" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>But there was yet another era consecrated in story-telling,
another age of history peopled by other characters, in which
the households of many chieftains and some even of the chiefs
themselves delighted. These are pictured in the romances that
were woven around Conn of the Hundred Battles, his son Art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
the Lonely, his grandson Cormac mac Art, and his great-grandson
Cairbré of the Liffey. This cycle of romance may
be called the "Fenian" Cycle, as dealing to some extent with
Finn mac Cúmhail and his Fenian<a name="FNanchor_2_524" id="FNanchor_2_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_524" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> militia, or the "Ossianic"
Cycle since Ossian, Finn's son, is supposed to have been the
author of many of the poems which belong to it.</p>

<p>In point of time&mdash;as reckoned by the Irish annalists and
historians&mdash;the men of the Fenian Cycle lived something over
two hundred years later than those of the Cuchulain era<a name="FNanchor_3_525" id="FNanchor_3_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_525" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and
in none of the romances do we see even the faintest confusion
or sign of intermingling the characters belonging to the
different cycles. One of the surest proofs&mdash;if proof were
needed&mdash;that Macpherson's brilliant "Ossian" had no Gaelic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
original, is the way in which the men and events of the two
separate cycles are jumbled together.</p>

<p>As the war between Ulster and Connacht, which followed
the death of the children of Usnach, is the great historic event
which serves as basis to so many of the Red Branch romances,
so the principal thread of history round which many of the
Fenian stories are woven, is the gradual and slowly increasing
enmity which proclaimed itself between the High-kings of
Erin and their Fenian cohorts, resulting at last in the battle of
Gabhra, the fall of the High-king, and the destruction of the
Fenians.</p>

<p>Thus in the battle of Cnucha is related how Cúmhail<a name="FNanchor_4_526" id="FNanchor_4_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_526" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
[Cool], the father of Finn, made war upon Conn of the
Hundred Battles because he had raised Criomhthan of the
Yellow Hair to the throne of Leinster, and how he obtained
the aid of the Munster princes in the war. At the battle of
Cnucha or Castleknock, near Cool's rath&mdash;now Rathcoole
some ten miles from Dublin&mdash;Cool was routed and slain by
the celebrated Connacht champion Aedh mac Morna, who
lost an eye in the battle and was thenceforth called Goll
(or the blind)<a name="FNanchor_5_527" id="FNanchor_5_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_527" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> mac Morna. Many of the Munster Fenians
followed Cool in this battle, and we find here the broadening
rift between the Fenians of Munster and of Connacht which
ultimately tended to bring about the dissolution of the whole
body.</p>

<p>Again we find in the fine tale called the Battle of Moy
Muchruime how Finn, through spite at his father Cool being
thus killed by Conn of the Hundred Battles, kept out of the
way when Conn's son Art was fighting the great battle of
Moy Muchruime and gave him no assistance.</p>

<p>And again it was partly because Finn kept out of the way
on that occasion that Conn's great-grandson fought the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
of Gabhra against Finn's son Ossian and his grandson Oscar, a
battle which put an end to Fenian power for ever.</p>

<p>Of many of these tales we find two redactions, that of the
old vellum MSS. and that of the modern paper ones, the latter
being as a rule much longer and more decorative. Here, for
instance, is the later version of one passage out of many which
is slurred over or disregarded in the old one<a name="FNanchor_6_528" id="FNanchor_6_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_528" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; it is the sailing of
Cúmhail, Finn's father, to Ireland to take the throne of Leinster.
I translate this from a modern manuscript of the battle of
Cnucha, in my own possession, as a good instance of the
decorative, and in places inflated style of the later redactions
of many of the Fenian sagas.</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>THE SAILING OF CÚMHAIL.</h4>


<p>"Now the place where Cúmhail chanced to be at that time was
between the islands of Alba and the deserts of Fionn-Lochlan, for
he was hunting and deer-stalking there. And the number of those
who were with the over-throwing hero Cúmhail in that place, was thrice
fifty champions of his own near men. And he heard at that time
that his country was left without any good king to defend it, and that
Cáthaoir Mór [king of Leinster] had fallen in the pen of battle, and
that there was no hero to keep the country. Thereupon, those
chieftains were of a mind to proceed unto the isolated green isle of
Erin, there to maintain with valour and might the red-hand province
of Leinster. And joyfully they proceeded straight forwards towards
their ship.<a name="FNanchor_7_529" id="FNanchor_7_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_529" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"And there they quickly and expeditiously launched the towering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
wide-wombed, broad-sailed bark, the freighted full-wide, fair-broad,
firm-roped vessel, and they grasped their shapely well-formed broad-bladed,
well-prepared oars, and they made a powerful sea-great,
dashing, dry-quick rowing over the broad hollow-deep, full-foamed,
pools [of the sea], and over the vast-billowed, vehement, hollow-broken
rollers, so that they shot their shapely ships under the
penthouse of each fair rock in the shallows nigh to the rough-bordered
margin of the Eastern lands, over the unsmooth, great-forming,
lively-waved arms of the sea, so that each fierce, broad,
constant-foaming, bright-spotted, white-broken drop that the heroes
left upon the sea-pool with that rapid rowing, formed [themselves]
like great torrents upon soft mountains.</p>

<p>"When that valiant powerful company perceived the moaning of
the loud billow-waves and the breaking forth of the ocean from her
barriers, and the swelling of the abyss from her places, and the loud
convulsion of the sea from her smooth streams, it was then they
hoisted the variegated, tough-cordaged, sharp-pointed mast with
much speed. And when the great foundation-blasts of the angry
wind touched the even upright-standing, sword-straight masts, and
when the huge-flying, loud-voiced, broad-bordered sails swallowed
the wind attacking them suddenly with sharp voice, that stout,
strong, active, powerful crew rose up promptly and quickly, and
every one went straight to his work with speed and promptitude, and
they stretched forth their ready courageous, white-coloured, brown-nailed
hands most valiantly to the tackling, till they let the wind in
loud, sharp, fast, voice-bursts into the shrouds of the mast, so that
the ship gave an eager, very quick, vigorous leap forward, right
straight into the salt-ocean, till they arrived in the delightfully-clear,
cold-pooled, querulously-whistling, joyfully-calling reaches of the
sea, and the dark sea rose speedily around them in desperate-daring
floodful <i>doisleana</i>, in hardly-separated ridges and in rough-grey,
proud-tongued, gloomy-grim, blue-capacious valleys, and in impetuous
shower-topped wombs [of water]; and the great merriment
of the cold wind was answered by the chieftains, strong-workingly,
stout-enduringly, truly-powerfully, and they proceeded to manage
and attend the high-ocean, until at last the strong and powerful sea
overcame the intention of the high wind, and the murmur and giddy
voice of the deep was humbled by that great rowing, till the sea became
restful, smooth, and very calm behind them, until they took port and
harbour at Inver Cholpa, which is at this time called Drogheda."</p></blockquote>

<p>The stories about Cormac mac Art, his grandfather Conn
of the Hundred Battles, and his son Cairbré of the Liffey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
which are numerous, are mostly more or less connected with
the Fenians, and may, as they deal with the same era and the
same characters, be conveniently classed along with the Fenian
sagas. One of the best known of these sagas is the Battle of
Moy Léana<a name="FNanchor_8_530" id="FNanchor_8_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_530" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in which Conn of the Hundred Battles slew his
rival Owen, who had forced from him half his kingdom.
Owen had lived for six years in Spain, and had married a
daughter of the Spanish king. At the end of this time he
was seized with great home-sickness and he proposed to
return to Ireland. When his father-in-law heard this, he said
to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If that Erin of which you speak, Owen, were a thing easily
moved, we would deem it easier to send the soldiers and
warriors of Spain with you thither to cut it from its foundation
and lay it on wheels and carry it after our ships and place it a
one angle of Spain"&mdash;a grandiloquent speech which Owen did
not relish; "He did not receive it with satisfaction, and it was
not sweet to him," says the saga.</p>

<p>The King perceived this however, and offered him just what
he wanted, two thousand warriors to help him and his exiles in
acquiring the kingdom. The account of their embarcation
and voyage is perhaps as good a specimen of exaggerated
verbosity and of the rhetoric of the professed story-teller as
any other in these sagas, which abound with such things,
and it is perhaps worth while to give it at length. It will
be seen that the story-teller or prose-poet, passes everything
through the prism of his imagination, and aided by an extraordinary
exuberance of vocabulary and unbounded wealth of
alliterative adjectives, wraps the commonest objects in a hurricane
of&mdash;to use his own phrase&mdash;"misty-dripping" epithet.
The Battle of Moy Léana is recorded in the Annals of Ulster,
by Flann in the eleventh century, and by the Book of Leinster,
and no doubt the essence of the saga is very ancient, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
dressing-up of it, and especially the passage I am about to quote,
is, in its style&mdash;not to speak of the language which is modern&mdash;almost
certainly post-Norman.</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>THE SAILING OF OWEN MÓR.</h4>


<p>"Then that vindictive unmerciful host went forward to the
harbours and ports where their vessels and their sailing ships
awaited them; and they launched their terrible wonderful monsters;
their black, dangerous, many-coloured ships; their smooth,
proper-sided, steady, powerful scuds, and their cunningly-stitched
<i>Laoidheangs</i> from their beds and from their capacious, full-smooth
places, out of the cool clear-winding creeks of the coast, and from the
calm, quiet, well-shaped, broad-headed harbours, and there were
placed upon every swift-going ship of them free and accurately
arranged tiers of fully-smoothed, long-bladed oars, and they made a
harmonious, united, co-operating, thick-framed, eager-springing,
unhesitating, constant-going rowing against currents and wild
tempests, so that loud, haughty, proud-minded, were the responses
of the stout, fierce-fronted, sportive-topped billows in conversing
with the scuds and beautiful prows.</p>

<p>"The dark, impetuous, proud, ardent waters became as white-streaked,
fierce-rolling, languid-fatigued <i>Leibhiona</i>, upon which to
cast the white-flanked, slippery, thick, straight-swimming salmon,
among the dark-prowling, foamy-tracked heads [of sea monsters]
from off the brown oars.</p>

<p>"And upon that fleet, sweeping with sharp rapidity from the sides
and borders of the territories, and from the shelter of the lands, and
from the calm quiet of the shores, they could see nothing of the
globe on their border near them, but the high, proud, tempestuous
waves of the abyss, and the rough, roaring shore, shaking and
quivering, and the very-quick, swift motion of the great wind
coming upon them, and long-swelling, gross-springing, great billows
rising over the swelling sides of the [sea] valleys, and the savage,
dangerous, shower-crested sea, maintaining its strength against the
rapid course of the vessels over the expanse, until at last it became
exhausted, subdued, drizzling and misty, from the conflict of the
waves and fierce winds.</p>

<p>"The labouring crews derived increased spirits from the bounding
of the swift ships over the wide expanse, and the wind coming from
the rear, directly fair for the brave men, they arose manfully and
vigorously to their work, and lashed the tough, new masts to the
brown, smooth, ample, commodious bulwarks, without weakness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
without spraining, without overstraining. Those ardent, expert
crews put their hands to the long linen [sails] without shrinking,
without mistake, from <i>Eibhil</i> to <i>Achtuaim</i>, and the swift-going, long,
capacious ships, passed from the hand-force of the warriors, and over
the deep, wet, murmuring pools of the sea, and past the winding,
bending, fierce-showery points of the harbours, and over the high-torrented,
ever-great mountains of the brine, and over the heavy,
listless walls of the great waves, and past the dark, misty-dripping
hollows of the shores, and past the saucy, thick-flanked, spreading,
white-crested currents of the streams, and over the spring-tide, contentious,
furious, wet, overwhelming fragments of the cold ocean, until
the sea became rocking like a soft, fragrant, proud-bearing plain, swelling
and heaving to the force of the anger and fury of the cold winds.</p>

<p>"The upper elements quickly perceived the anger and fury of the
sea growing and increasing. Woe indeed was it to have stood
between those two powers, the sea and the great wind when mutually
attacking each other, and contending at the sides of strong ships and
stout-built vessels and beautiful scuds. So that the sea was in
showery-tempestuous, growling, wet, fierce, loud, clamorous, dangerous
stages after them, whilst the excitement of the murmuring
dark-deeded wind continued in the face and in the sluices of the
ocean from its bottom to its surface. And tremulous, listless, long-disjointed,
quick-shattering, ship-breaking, was the effect of the disturbance,
and treacherous the shivering of the winds and the rolling
billows upon the swift barks, for the tempest did not leave them a
plank unshaken, nor a hatch unstarted, nor a rope unsnapped, nor a
nail unstrained, nor a bulwark unendangered, nor a bed unshattered,
nor a lifting uncast-down, nor a mast unshivered, nor a yard untwisted,
nor a sail untorn, nor a warrior unhurt, nor a soldier unterrified, nor
a noble unstunned&mdash;excepting the ardour and sailorship of the brave
men who attended to the attacks and howlings of the fierce wind.</p>

<p>"However, now, when the wind had exhausted its valour and had
not received reverence nor honour from the sea, it went forward,
stupid and crestfallen, to the uppermost regions of its residence;
and the sea was fatigued from its roarings and drunken murmurings,
and the wild billows ceased their motions, so that spirit returned to
he nobles and strength to the hosts, and activity to the warriors, and
strength to the champions. And they sailed onwards in that order
without delay or accident until they reached the sheltered smooth
harbour of Cealga and the shore of the island of Greagraidhe."</p></blockquote>

<p>Who or what the Fenians were, has given rise to the greatest
diversity of opinion. The school of Mr. Nutt and Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
Rhys would, I fancy, recognise in them nothing but tribal
deities, euhemerised or regarded as men.<a name="FNanchor_9_531" id="FNanchor_9_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_531" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Dr. Skene and Mr.
Mac Ritchie believed that they were an altogether separate
race of men from the Gaels, probably allied to, or identical with,
the Picts of history; and the latter holds that they are the <i>sidhe</i>
[shee] or fairy folk of the Gaels. The native Irish, on the
other hand, who were perfectly acquainted with the Picts, and
tell us much about them, have always regarded the Fenians as
being nothing more or less than a body of janissaries or standing
troops of Gaelic and Firbolg families, maintained during several
reigns by the Irish kings, a body which tended to become
hereditary. Nor is there in this account anything inherently
impossible or improbable, especially as the Fenian régime
synchronises with a time when the Irish were probably
aggressively warlike. Keating, writing in Irish about the year
1630, gives the traditional account of them as he gathered it
from ancient books and other authorities now lost, and this
certainly preserves some ancient and unique traits. He begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
by rejecting the ridiculous stories told about them, such as the
battle of Ventry and the like, as well as the remarks of
Campion and of Buchanan, who in his history of Scotland
had called Finn a giant.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is proved," writes Keating, "that their persons were of no
extraordinary size compared with the men that lived in their own
times, and moreover that they were nothing more than members of
a body of <i>buanadha</i> or retained soldiers, maintained by the Irish
kings for the purpose of guarding their territories and of upholding
their authority therein. It is thus that captains and soldiers are at
present maintained by all modern kings for the purpose of defending
their rule and guarding their countries.</p>

<p>"The members of the Fenian Body lived in the following manner.
They were quartered on the people from November Day till May
Day, and their duty was to uphold justice and to put down injustice
on the part of the kings and lords of Ireland, and also to guard the
harbours of the country from the oppression of foreign invaders.
After that, from May till November, they lived by hunting and the
chase, and by performing the duties demanded of them by the kings
of Ireland, such as preventing robberies, exacting fines and tributes,
putting down public enemies, and every other kind of evil that might
afflict the country. In performing these duties they received a
certain fixed pay....</p>

<p>"However, from May till November the Fenians had to content
themselves with game, the product of their own hunting, as this
[right to hunt] was their maintenance and pay from the kings
of Ireland. That is, the warriors had the flesh of the wild animals
for their food, and the skins for wages. During the whole day, from
morning till night they used to eat but one meal, and of this it was
their wont to partake towards evening. About noon they used
to send whatever game they had killed in the morning by their
attendants to some appointed hill where there were wood and moorland
close by. There they used to light immense fires, into which
they put a large quantity of round sandstones. They next dug two
pits in the yellow clay of the moor, and having set part of the venison
upon spits to be roasted before the fire they bound up the remainder
with sugàns&mdash;ropes of straw or rushes&mdash;in bundles of sedge, and then
placed them to be cooked in one of the pits they had previously dug.
There they set the stones which they had before this heated in the
fire, round about them, and kept heaping them upon the bundles of
meat until they had made them seethe freely, and the meat had
become thoroughly cooked. From the greatness of these fires it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
resulted that their sites are still to be recognised in many parts of
Ireland by their burnt blackness. It is they that are commonly
called <i>Fualachta na bhFiann</i>, or the Fenians' cooking-spots.</p>

<p>"As to the warriors of the Fenians, when they were assembled at
the place where their fires had been lighted, they used to gather
round the second of those pits of which we have spoken above, and
there every man stripped himself to his skin, tied his tunic round his
waist, and then set to dressing his hair and cleansing his limbs, thus
ridding himself of the sweat and soil of the day's hunt. Then they
began to supple their thews and muscles by gentle exercise, loosening
them by friction, until they had relieved themselves of all sense
of stiffness and fatigue. When they had finished doing this they sat
down and ate their meal. That being over, they set about constructing
their <i>fiann-bhotha</i> or hunting-booths, and preparing their
beds, and so put themselves in train for sleep. Of the following three
materials did each man construct his bed, of the brushwood of the
forest, of moss, and of fresh rushes. The brushwood was laid next
the ground, over it was placed the moss, and lastly fresh rushes were
spread over all. It is these three materials that are designated in our
old romances as the <i>tri Cuilcedha na bhFiann</i>&mdash;the three Beddings of
the Fenians."</p></blockquote>

<p>Every man who entered the Fenian ranks had four <i>geasa</i>
[gassa, <i>i.e.</i>, tabus] laid upon him,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first, never to receive a portion with a wife, but to choose
her for good manners and virtues; the second, never to offer violence
to any woman; the third, never to refuse any one for anything he
might possess; the fourth, that no single warrior should ever flee
before nine [<i>i.e.</i>, before less than ten] champions."</p></blockquote>

<p>There was a curious condition attached to entrance into the
brotherhood which rendered it necessary that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Both his father and mother, his tribe, and his relatives should
first give guarantees that they should never make any charge against
any person for his death. This was in order that the duty of avenging
his own blood [wounds] should rest with no man other than
himself, and in order that his friends should have nothing to claim
with respect to him however great the evils inflicted upon him."</p></blockquote>

<p>All the Fenians were obliged to know the rules of poetry,<a name="FNanchor_10_532" id="FNanchor_10_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_532" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
for no figure in Irish antiquity, layman or cleric, could ever
arrive at the rank of a popular hero unless he could compose,
or at least appreciate a poem.</p>

<p>The Fenian tales and poems are extraordinarily numerous,
but their conception and characteristics are in general distinctly
different from those relating to the Red Branch. They have
not the same sweep, the same vastness and stature, the same
weirdness, as the older cycle. The majority of them are more
modern in conception and surroundings. There is little or no
mention of the war chariot which is so important a factor in
the older cycle. The Fenians fought on foot or horseback,
and we meet, too, frequent mention of helmets and mail-coats,
which are post-Danish touches. Things are on a smaller
scale. Exaggeration does not run all through the stories, but
is confined to small parts of them, and it is set off by much
that is trivial or humorous.</p>

<p>The Fenian stories became in later times the distinctly
popular ones. They were far more of the people and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
people than those of the Red Branch. They were most
intimately bound up with the life and thought and feelings of
the whole Gaelic race, high and low, both in Ireland and
Scotland, and the development of Fenian saga, for a period of
1,200 or 1,500 years, is one of the most remarkable examples
in the world of continuous literary evolution. I use the word
evolution advisedly, for there was probably not a century from
the seventh to the eighteenth in which new stories, poems, and
redactions of sagas concerning Finn and the Fenians were not
invented and put in circulation, while to this very day many
stories never committed to manuscript are current about them
amongst the Irish and Scotch Gaelic-speaking populations.
We have found no such steady interest evinced by the people
in the Red Branch romances, and in attempting to collect
Irish folk-lore I have found next to nothing about Cuchulain
and his contemporaries, but great quantities about Finn,
Ossian, Oscar, Goll, and Conan. The one cycle, then, antique
in tone, language, and surroundings, was, I suspect, that of the
chiefs, the great men, and the bards; the other&mdash;at least in later
times&mdash;more that of the un-bardic classes and of the people.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that many of the Cuchulain stories
were not copied into modern MSS. and circulated freely among
the people all over Ireland during the eighteenth century
and the beginning of this, especially Cuchulain's training,
Conlaoch's (his son's) death, the Fight at the Ford, and others,
but these appear never to have put out shoots and blossoms
from themselves and to have generated new and yet again new
stories as did the ever-youthful Fenian tales; nor do they
appear to have equally entwined themselves at this day round
the popular imagination.</p>

<p>A striking instance of how the Ossianic tale continued to
develop down to the eighteenth century was supplied me the
other day when examining the Reeves Collection.<a name="FNanchor_11_533" id="FNanchor_11_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_533" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> I there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
came upon a story in a Louth MS., written, I think, in the
last century, which seemed to me to contain one of the latest
developments of Ossianic saga. It is called "The Adventures
of Dubh mac Deaghla," and tells us of how a prophet was
born of the race of Eiremóin, "and all say," adds the writer,
"that it was he was the druid who prophesied to Fiacha
Sreabhtainne that he should fall in the battle of Dubh-Cumair
by the three brothers, Cairioll, Muircath, and Aodh." He
also "prophesied to the race of Tuathal that Cairbré of the
Liffey was that far-branching tree which was to spread round
about through the great circuit of Erin, around which smote
the powerful wind from the south-west, overthrowing it wholly
to the ground&mdash;which wind meant the Fenians, as had been
announced by the smith's daughter."<a name="FNanchor_12_534" id="FNanchor_12_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_534" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Fenians it seems
heard that this Torna had prophesied about them and intended
to kill him, and he and his family had to emigrate to Britain.
From there he sends a letter in true epistolary style to an old
friend of his, one Conor son of Dathach, beginning "Dear
Friend"&mdash;an evident mark of seventeenth or possibly eighteenth
century authorship, for there are no letters written in this
style in the older literature, and this piece evidently follows a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
Latin or a Spanish, or possibly an English model. However
this may be, Torna's letter asks Conor for news of the situation,
and in time receives the following answer:</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>"<i>To Torna son of Dubh, our dear friend in Glen Fuinnse in
Britain in Saxony.</i></h4>

<p>"Thy affectionate missive was read by me as soon as it arrived,
and it had been a cause of joy to me, were it not for the way we are
in at Tara at this moment.</p>

<p>"For we never felt until the Munster Fenians came and encamped
at the marsh of Old Raphoe and Treibhe to the south-west; the
warriors of Leinster also and <i>Baoisgnidh</i>, together with Clan Ditribh
and Clan Boirchne, were to the south of them, towards the bottom
of the stream of Gabhra and on the west towards the old fort of
Mève; and that same evening the King having received an account
of the encamping of the Fenians urges messengers secretly to
Connacht to the Clan of Conal Cruachna that they might come,
along with all the king's friends from the western border of Erin;
and other messengers he despatches to Scotland for the Clan of
Garaidh Glúnmhar, desiring Oscar of the blue Javelin, Aodh, Argal,
and Airtre to come from abroad without delay, and that secretly.</p>

<p>"On the early morning of the morrow, before the stars of the air
retired, the King urged the druids of Tara against the Fenians to
argue with them, and ask what was the cause of their rebelling in
this guise, or who it was with whom they had now come to do
battle, because they appeared not in habiliments of peace or friendship,
but a flush of anger appeared in the face and countenance of
every several man of them.</p>

<p>"'And there is another unlawful thing of which ye are guilty,'
said the druids, 'which shows that ye have broken the vow of
allegiance and obedience to your king, in that ye have come in array
and garb of battle to the door of his fortress without receiving his
leave or advice, without giving him notice or warning. To what
point of the compass do ye travel, or on what have ye set your
mind [that ye act not] as is the right and due of a prince's subjects,
and as was always before this the habitude of the bands that came
before ye; and as shall last with honest people till the end of the
world.'</p>

<p>"However, now the druids are a-preaching to them and casting at
them bold storm-showers of reproofs by way of retarding them till
the coming back of the messengers who went abroad, for Mac Cool
is not amongst them to excite them against us, and we hope that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
they will remain thus until help come to us. For this is the eleventh
day since the druids went from us, and our watchmen who observe
what approaches and what goes, disclose all tidings to us, and they
are ever a-listening to the loud argument of the druids and the
captains against one another. Moreover, the desire of the Fenians
to make a rapid assault upon Tara is the less from their having heard
that Cairbré was gone on his royal round to Dun Sreabhtainne to
visit Fiacha,<a name="FNanchor_13_535" id="FNanchor_13_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_535" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> though he is really not gone there, but to a certain
place under cover of night with his women and the royal jewels of
Tara. And it was lucky for him that he did not go to Dun Sreabhtainne,
for the Fenians had sent Cairioll and nine mighty men with
him to plunder Dun Sreabhtainne. In that, however, they miscarried,
for his tutor was gone off before that with Fiacha, by order
of the King, to the same place where the women were. That, however,
we shall pursue no further at present.</p>

<p>"But it is easy for you who are knowledgeable to form a judgment
upon the state in which the inhabitants of a country must be, over
which such a whelming calamity is about to fall. Let me leave off.
And here we send our affectionate greeting to you, and to you all,
with the hope of some time seeing you in full health, but I have
small hope of it.</p>

<p>"From your faithful friend till death, Conor, son of Dathach in
Tara, the royal fortress of Erin. Written the 20th day of the
month of March in the year of the age of the world ... "
[The figures in the MS. are not legible].</p></blockquote>

<p>The romance, which is a long one, is chiefly occupied
with events relating to the family of Dubh mac Deaghla in
Britain. But later on in the book the Conor who despatched
this letter turns up and gives in person a most vivid description of
the Battle of Gowra, and the events which followed his letter.</p>

<p>I have only instanced and quoted from this comparatively
unimportant story, as showing one of the very latest developments
of Fenian literature, and as proving how thoroughly even
the seventeenth and eighteenth century Gaels were imbued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
with, and realised the spirit of, the Fenian Cycle, and also as a
peculiar specimen of what rarely happens in literature, but is
always of great interest when it does happen&mdash;a specimen of
unconscious saga developing into semi-conscious romance.</p>

<p>There are comparatively few ancient texts belonging to the
Finn saga, compared with the wealth of old vellum books that
contain the Red Branch stories. There is, however, quite
enough of documentary proof to show that so early as the
seventh century Finn was looked on as a popular hero.</p>

<p>The actual data that we have to go upon in estimating
the genesis and development of the Fenian tales have been
lucidly collected by Mr. Nutt. They are, as far as is known
at present, as follows. Gilla Caemhain, the poet who died in
1072, says that it was fifty-seven years after the battle of Moy
Muchruime that Finn was treacherously killed "by the spear
points of Urgriu's three sons."<a name="FNanchor_14_536" id="FNanchor_14_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_536" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This would make Finn's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
death take place in 252, for Moy Muchruime was fought
according to the "Four Masters" in A.D. 195. Tighearnach
the Annalist, who died in 1088, writes that Finn was killed in
A.D. 283, "by Aichleach, son of Duibhdrean, and the sons of
Urgriu of the Luaighni of Tara, at Ath-Brea upon the Boyne."
The poet Cinaeth O Hartagain, who died in A.D. 985, wrote:
"By the Fiann of Luagne was the death of Finn at Ath-Brea
upon the Boyne." All these men in the tenth and eleventh
centuries certainly believed in Finn as implicitly as they did in
King Cormac.</p>

<p>The two oldest miscellaneous Irish MSS. which we have,
are the Leabhar na h-Uidhre and the Book of Leinster. The
Leabhar na h-Uidhre was compiled from older MSS. towards
the close of the eleventh century, and the Book of Leinster
some fifty years later. The oldest of them contains a copy of
the famous poem ascribed to Dallán Forgaill in praise of St.
Columcille, which was so obscure in the middle of the eleventh
century that it required to be glossed. In this gloss, made
perhaps in the eleventh century, perhaps long before, there is
an explanatory poem on winter, ascribed to Finn, grandson of
Baoisgne, that is our Finn mac Cool, and in the same commentary
we find an explanation of the words "diu" = long, and
"derc" = eye, in proof of which this verse is quoted, "As
Gráinne," says the commentator, "daughter of Cormac, said to
Finn."</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"There lives a man</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On whom I would love to gaze long,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For whom I would give the whole world,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O Son of Mary! though a privation!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>This verse, quoted as containing two words which required
explanation in or before the eleventh century, pre-supposes the
story of Diarmuid and Gráinne. In addition to this we have
the apparently historical story of the "Cause of the Battle of
Cnucha." We have also the story of the Mongan, an Ulster
king of the seventh century, according to the annalists who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
declared that he was not what men took him to be, the son of
the mortal Fiachna, but of the god Mananán mac Lir, and a
re-incarnation of the great Finn, and calls back from the grave
the famous Fenian, Caoilte, who proves it. This account is
strongly relied upon by Mr. Nutt to prove the wild mythological
nature of the Finn story, but it is by no means unique
in Irish literature, for we find the celebrated Tuan mac Cairrill
had a second birth also, and the great Cuchulain too has his
parentage ascribed to the god Lugh, not to Sualtach, his
reputed father. Consequently, supposing Finn to have been
a real historical character of the third century, there would be
nothing absolutely extraordinary in the story arising in half
pagan times that Mongan, also an historical character, was a
re-incarnation of Finn.</p>

<p>In the second oldest miscellaneous manuscript, the Book of
Leinster, the references to Finn and the Fenians are much
more numerous, containing three poems ascribed to Ossian,
Finn's son, five poems ascribed to Finn himself, two poems
ascribed to Caoilte the Fenian poet, a poem ascribed to one of
Finn's followers, allusions to Finn in poems by one Gilla in
Chomded and another, passages from the Dinnsenchas or
topographical tract about Finn, the account of the battle of
Cnámhross, in which Finn helps the Leinstermen against King
Cairbré, the genealogy of Finn, and the genealogy of Diarmuid
O'Duibhne.</p>

<p>Again, in the Glossary ascribed, and probably truly, to
Cormac, King-Bishop of Cashel, A.D. 837-903, there are two
allusions to Finn, one of which refers to the unfaithfulness of
his wife. This, indeed, is not contained in the oldest copy,
but Whitley Stokes, than whom there can be no better
authority, believes these allusions to belong to the older
portion of the Glossary, a work which is probably much
interpolated.</p>

<p>But there is yet another proof of the antiquity of the Finn
stories which Mr. Nutt does not note, and in some respects it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
the most important and conclusive of all. For if, as D'Arbois
de Jubainville has, I think, proved, the list of 187 historic tales
contained in the Book of Leinster was really drawn up at the
end of the seventh or beginning of the eighth century, we
find that even then Finn or his contemporaries were the
subjects of, or figure in, several of them, as in the story
of "The Courtship of Ailbhe, daughter of King Cormac
mac Art, by Finn," "The Battle of Moy Muchruime,"
where King Art, Cormac's father, was slain; "The Cave
of Bin Edair," where Diarmuid and Gráinne took shelter
when pursued by Finn; "The Adventures of Finn in
Derc Fearna (the cave of Dunmore)," a lost tale; "The
Elopement of Gráinne with Diarmuid," and perhaps one or
two more.</p>

<p>Thus Finn is sandwiched in as a real person along with his
other contemporaries, not only in tenth and eleventh century
annalists and poets, but is also made the hero of historic
romance as early as the seventh or eighth century. Side by
side in our list with the battle of Moy Muchruime we have
the battle of Moy Rath. Copies of both, coloured with the
same literary pigments, exist. The last we <i>know</i> to be historical,
it can be proved; why should not the first be also?
It is true that the one took place 438 years before the other,
but the treatment of both is absolutely identical, and it is the
merest accident that we happen to have external evidence
for the latter and not for the former. I can see, then, no
sufficiently cogent reasons for viewing Finn mac Cúmhail with
different eyes from those with which we regard his king.
Cormac mac Art is usually acknowledged to have been a real
king of flesh and blood, whose buildings are yet seen on the site
of Tara, after whose daughter Gráinne one of them is named,
why should Finn, his chief captain, who married that Gráinne,
be a deity euhemerised? I do not see any arguments sufficient
to differentiate this case of Finn, to whom no particular supernatural
qualities (except the knowledge he got when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
chewed his thumb) are attributed, from that of Cormac and
other kings and heroes who were the subjects of bardic stories,
and whose deaths were recorded in the Annals, except the accident
that the creative imagination of the later Gaels happened
to seize upon him and make him and his contemporaries the
nucleus of a vast literature instead of some earlier or later
group of perhaps equally deserving champions. Finn has long
since become to all ears a pan-Gaelic champion just as Arthur
has become a Brythonic one.</p>

<p>Of the Fenian sagas the longest&mdash;though it is only
fragmentary&mdash;is that known as the Dialogue or Colloquy
of the Ancients, which is preserved in the Book of Lismore,
and would fill about 250 of these pages. The plot of
it is simple enough. Caoilte [Cweeltya] the poet and
Ossian, almost sole survivors of the Fenians&mdash;who had lived
on after the battle of Gabhra, where Cairbré, the High-king,
broke their power for ever&mdash;meet in their very old age
St. Patrick and the new preachers of the gospel. Patrick
is most desirous of learning the past history of the island from
them, and the legends connected with streams and hills and
raths and so forth, and these are willingly recounted to him,
and were all written<a name="FNanchor_15_537" id="FNanchor_15_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_537" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> down by Brogan Patrick's scribe for
posterity to read hereafter. The saga describes their wanderings
along with the saint, the stories they relate to
him, and the verses&mdash;over a couple of thousand&mdash;sung or
repeated by them to the clerics and others.<a name="FNanchor_16_538" id="FNanchor_16_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_538" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Some of these
pieces are exceedingly beautiful. Here is a specimen, the
lament which Credé made over her husband who was
drowned at the battle of Ventry. Caoilte repeats the verses
to Patrick:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The haven roars, and O the haven roars, over the rushing race of
<i>Rinn-da-bharc</i>. The drowning of the warrior of <i>Loch-da-chonn</i>, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
is what the wave impinging on the strand laments.<a name="FNanchor_17_539" id="FNanchor_17_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_539" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Melodious is
the crane, and O melodious is the crane, in the marshlands of <i>Druim-dá-thrén</i>.
'Tis she who may not save her brood alive. The wild dog
of two colours is intent upon her nestlings. A woful note, and O a
woful note is that which the thrush in Drumqueen emits, but not
more cheerful is the wail which the blackbird makes in Letterlee. A
woful sound, and O a woful sound, is that the deer utters in Drumdaleish.
Dead lies the doe of Drumsheelin,<a name="FNanchor_18_540" id="FNanchor_18_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_540" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the mighty stag bells
after her. Sore suffering, and O suffering sore, is the hero's death,
his death, who used to lie by me.... Sore suffering to me is Cael, and
O Cael is a suffering sore, that by my side he is in dead man's form;
that the wave should have swept over his white body, that is what
hath distracted me, so great was his delightfulness. A dismal roar,
and O a dismal roar, is that the shore's surf makes upon the strand....
A woful booming, and O a boom of woe, is that which the wave
makes upon the northward beach, butting as it does against the
polished rock, lamenting for Cael now that he is gone. A woful
fight, and O a fight of woe, is that the wave wages with the southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
shore. A woful melody, and O a melody of woe, is that which the
heavy surge of Tullacleish emits. As for me the calamity which has
fallen upon me having shattered me, for me prosperity exists no
more."</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the Fenian saga, next in length and certainly in
merit, is the well-known "Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne."<a name="FNanchor_19_541" id="FNanchor_19_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_541" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Diarmuid of the Love-spot unwittingly causes Gráinne, daughter
of Cormac mac Art, the High-king, to fall in love with him,
just on the eve of her marriage with his captain, Finn mac
Cool. He is driven to elope with her, and is pursued round
Ireland by the vengeful Finn, who succeeds after many years in
compassing the death of the generous and handsome Diarmuid
by a wild boar, and then winning back to himself the love of
the fickle Gráinne.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_523" id="Footnote_1_523"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_523"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Moore's genius has stereotyped amongst us the term Red Branch
knight, which, however, has too much flavour of the mediæval about it.
The Irish is <i>curadh</i>, "hero." The Irish for "Knight" in the appellations
White Knight, Knight of the Glen, etc., is Ridire (pronounced "R&#301;d-&#301;r-y&#259;,"
in Connacht sometimes corruptly "Rud-ir-ya"), which is evidently the
mediæval "Ritter," <i>i.e.</i>, Rider.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_524" id="Footnote_2_524"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_524"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Moore helped to bring this word into common use under the form of
Finnian in his melody, "The wine-cup is circling in Alvin's hall." It is
probable that he derived the word from Finn, and meant by it "followers
of Finn mac Cool." The Irish word is Fiann (pronounced "Fee-an") and
has nothing to do with Finn mac Cúmhail. In the genitive it is nà Féine
(na Fayna). It is a noun of multitude, and means the Fenian body in
general. The individual Fenian was called Féinnidhe, <i>i.e.</i>, a member of
the Fenian force. The bands of militia were called Fianna [Fee-&#259;n-a],
The word is declined <i>An Fhiann, na Féinne, do'n Fhéinn</i> [In Eean, n&#259;
Fayn-a, don Aen] and its resemblance to the proper name Finn is only
accidental. The English translation of Keating made early in the last
century, by Dermot O'Conor, does not use the term "Fenian" at all, but
translates the word by "Irish Militia." Nor does O'Halloran, in 1778,
when he published his history, seem to have known the term. The first
person who appears to have used it is Miss Brooke, as early as 1796: in
her translation of some Ossianic pieces, I find the lines&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He cursed in rage the Fenian chief</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the Fenian race."</span><br />
</p>
<p>
I have been told that Macpherson had already used the word, but I have
looked carefully through his Ossian and have not been able to find it.
Halliday in his edition of Keating, in 1808, talks in a foot-note of "Fenian
heroes." It was John O'Mahony the head-centre of the Irish Republican
Brotherhood, a brilliant Irish scholar and translator of Keating, who
succeeded in perpetuating the ancient historic memory by christening the
"men of '68" the "Fenians."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_9_531" id="Footnote_9_531"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_531"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Mr. Nutt seems to believe that the whole groundwork of the Fenian
tales is mythical. His position with regard to them is fairly summed up
in this extract from his note on Mac Innes' Gaelic stories. "Every Celtic
tribe," he writes, "possessed traditions both mythical and historical, the
former of substantially the same character, the latter necessarily varying.
Myth and history acted and reacted upon each other, and produced heroic
saga which may be defined as myth tinged and distorted by history. The
largest element is as a rule suggested by myth, so that the varying heroic
sagas of the various portions of a race, have always a great deal in common.
These heroic sagas, together with the official or semi-official mythologies
of the pre-Christian Irish are the subject-matter of the Annals. They were
thrown into a purely artificial chronological shape by men familiar with
biblical and classical history. A framework was thus created into which
the entire mass of native legend was gradually fitted, whilst the genealogies
of the race were modelled, or it may be remodelled in accord with it. In
studying the Irish sagas we may banish entirely from our mind all questions
as to the truth of the early portions of the Annals. The subject
matter of the latter is mainly mythical, the mode in which it has been
treated is literary. What residuum of historic truth may still survive can
be but infinitesimal." (<i>See</i> Mr. Nutt's valuable essay on Ossianic or
Fenian Saga in "Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition," vol. ii. p. 399.)</p></div>

vellum in the British Museum, marked "Egerton, 1782," "not a man was
taken until he was a prime poet versed in the twelve books of poetry. No
man was taken till in the ground a large hole had been made such as to
reach the fold of his belt, and he put into it with his shield and a forearm's
length of a hazel stick. Then must nine warriors having nine spears,
with a ten furrows' width between them and him, assail him, and in
concert let fly at him. If he were then hurt past that guard of his, he was
not received into the Fian-ship. Not a man of them was taken until his
hair had been interwoven into braids on him, and he started at a run
through Ireland's woods, while they seeking to wound him followed in his
wake, there having been between him and them but one forest bough by
way of interval at first. Should he be overtaken he was wounded and not
received into the Fian-ship after. If his weapons had quivered in his
hand he was not taken. Should a branch in the wood have disturbed
anything of his hair out of its braiding he was not taken. If he had
cracked a dry stick under his foot [as he ran] he was not accepted.
Unless that [at full speed] he had both jumped a stick level with his
brow, and stooped to pass under one on a level with his knee, he was not
taken. Unless also without slackening his pace he could with his nail
extract a thorn from his foot he was not taken into the Fian-ship. But if
he performed all this he was of Finn's people." (<i>See</i> "Silva Gadelica,"
p. 100 of English vol.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_11_533" id="Footnote_11_533"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_533"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> These MSS. volumes, fifty-four in number, had most of them belonged
to Mr. MacAdam, editor of the "Ulster Journal of Archæology," from
whom Bishop Reeves bought them. On the lamented death of that great
scholar they were put up to auction, when the Royal Irish Academy
bought some thirty volumes, the rest unfortunately were allowed to be
scattered again to the four winds of heaven. For his exertions and
generosity in securing even so many of these MSS., especially those which
at first sight looked least important, but which contained treasures of
folk-lore and folk-song, the Hon. Treasurer, the Rev. Maxwell Close, has
placed Irish-speaking Ireland under yet another debt of gratitude to him.
It is not always that which is most ancient which is most valuable from a
literary or a national point of view. The pity of it is that any Irish MS.
that comes into the market should not be bought up for the nation with
the money assigned by the Government and confided to the Royal Irish
Academy for Irish studies, unless a special search should show <i>that
the Academy already possesses a copy of each piece in it</i>. I am convinced
that many hundreds or thousands of pieces have been through neglect to
do this irreparably lost to the nation. Oh the pity of it!</p></div>

more remarkable for their personal prowess, their valour, and their
corporeal stature than Finn. The reason why he was made king of the
Fiann, and set over the warriors, was simply because his father and grandfather
had held that position before him. Another reason also why he had
been made king of the Fiann was because he excelled his contemporaries
in intellect and learning, in wisdom and in subtlety, and in experience and
hardihood in battlefields. It was for these qualities that he was made
king of the Fiann, and not for his personal prowess or for the great size
or strength of his body."
</p>
<p>
"Warrior better than Finn," says an old vellum MS. in the British
Museum, "never struck his hand into chiefs, inasmuch as for service he
was a soldier, a hospitaller for hospitality, and in heroism a hero. In
fighting functions he was a fighting man, and in strength a champion
worthy of a king, so that ever since and from that until this, it is with
Finn that every such is co-ordinated."
</p>
<p>
And in another place the same vellum says, "A good man verily was he
who had those Fianna, for he was the seventh king ruling Ireland, that is
to say, there were five kings of the provinces, and the King of Ireland, he
being himself the seventh conjointly with the King of all Ireland."
</p>
<p>
In a MS. saga in my own possession, called "The Pursuit of Sadhbh
(Sive)," there is an amusing account of the truculence of the Fenians
about their exclusive right of hunting, and the way they terrorised the
people they were quartered on, but I have not space for this extract.</p></div>

"Colloquy," but curiously enough I find the same passage in the saga
called the Battle of Ventry, which Kuno Meyer published in "Anecdota
Oxoniensia" from a fifteenth-century vellum in the Bodleian. The lady is
there called Gelges [white swan], and as she sought for Cael among the
slain "she saw the crane of the meadow and her two birds and the wily
beast yclept the fox a-watching of her birds, and when she covered one
of the birds to save it he would make a rush at the other bird, so that the
crane had to stretch herself out between them both, so that she would
rather have found and suffered death by the wild beast than that her birds
should be killed by him. And Gelges mused on this greatly and said, 'I
wonder not that I so love my fair sweetheart, since this little bird is in such
distress about its birdlets.'" She heard, moreover, a wild stag on Drum
Reelin above the harbour, and it was vehemently bewailing the hind from
one pass to the other, for they had been nine years together and had
dwelt in the wood that was at the foot of the harbour, the wood of Feedesh,
and the hind had been killed by Finn, and the stag was nineteen days
without tasting grass or water, mourning for the hind. "It is no shame
for me," said Gelges, "to find death with grief for Cael, as the stag is
shortening his life for grief of the hind," etc.</p></div>

<h4>MISCELLANEOUS ROMANCE</h4>


<p>In addition to the stories that centre round Cuchulain and
round Finn there are a number of miscellaneous ones dealing
with episodes or characters in Irish history; some are in
short groups or minor cycles, but others are completely independent
tales. All are built upon lines similar to those which
we have been considering, and they are composed for the most
part in a mixture of both verse and prose. Some of these sagas
deal with pre-Christian times, and others with the early
mediæval period. Very few, if any, deal with post-Danish
and still fewer with post-Norman subjects. The seventh
century was the golden era of the Irish saga, and nothing that
the race did in later times improved on it. Out of the hundred
and eighty-seven stories whose names are preserved in the Book
of Leinster, in a list which must have been, as D'Arbois de
Jubainville points out, drawn up in the seventh century, about one
hundred and twenty seem to have utterly perished. Of the others&mdash;many
of which, however, are preserved only in the baldest
and most condensed form&mdash;some four or five relate to the Fenian
Cycle, some eighteen are Red Branch stories, and some eight or
nine, mostly preserved in the colourless digests of the Book of
Invasions, are mythological. About twenty-one of the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
belong to minor groups, or are miscellaneous single tales. Some
of them are of the highest interest and antiquity. Of these the
storming of the Bruidhean [Bree-an] or Court of Dá Derga
is, after the Táin Bo Chuailgne, probably the oldest and most
important saga in the whole range of Irish literature.</p>

<p>These two stories substantially dating from the seventh
century, and perhaps formed into shape long before that time,
are preserved in the oldest miscellaneous MSS. which we possess,
and throw more light upon pagan manners, customs, and
institutions than perhaps any other.<a name="FNanchor_1_566" id="FNanchor_1_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_566" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The period in which the Court-of-Dá-Derga story is laid
is about coincident with that of the Red Branch Cycle,
only it does not deal with Emania, and the Red Branch, but
with Leinster, Tara, and the High-king of Erin, who was
there resident. The High-king at this time was the celebrated
Conairè the "Great," and rightly, if we may believe our
Annals, was he so called, for he had been a just, magnanimous, and
above all fortunate ruler of all Ireland for fifty years.<a name="FNanchor_2_567" id="FNanchor_2_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_567" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> So just
was he, and so strict, that he had sent into banishment a
number of lawless and unworthy persons who troubled his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
kingdom. Among these were his own five foster brothers
whom he was reluctantly compelled to send into exile along
with the others. These people all turned to piracy, and
plundered the coasts of England, Scotland, and even Ireland,
wherever they found an opportunity of making a successful
raid upon the unarmed inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_3_568" id="FNanchor_3_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_568" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It so happened that the
son of the King of Britain, one Ingcel, also of Irish extraction,
had been banished by his father for his crimes, and was now
making his living in much the same way as the predatory
Irishmen. These two parties having met, being drawn
together by a fellow-feeling and their common lawlessness,
struck up a friendship, and made a league with one another,
thus doubling the strength of each. Soon after this the High-king
found himself in Clare, called thither to settle, according
to his wont, some dispute between rival chiefs. His business
ended, he was leisurely taking his way with his retinue back
to his royal seat at Tara, when on entering the borders of
Meath he beheld the whole country in the direction of his city
a sheet of flame and rolling smoke. Terrified at this, and
divining that the banished pirates had made a descent on his
capital during his absence, he turned aside and took the great
road that, leading from Tara to Dublin, passed thence into the
heart of Leinster. Pursuing this road the King crossed the
Liffey in safety and made for the Bruighean [Bree-an] or Court
of Dá Derg on the road close to the river Dothar or Dodder,
called ever since Boher-na-breena,<a name="FNanchor_4_569" id="FNanchor_4_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_569" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the "road of the Court,"
close to Tallacht, not far from Dublin. This was one of the
six great courts of universal hospitality<a name="FNanchor_5_570" id="FNanchor_5_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_570" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in Erin, and Dá Derg,
its master, was delighted and honoured by the visit from the
High-king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>The pirates having plundered Tara, took to their vessels,
and having laden them with their spoils were now under a
favourable breeze running along the sea coast towards the Hill
of Howth, when they perceived from afar the King's company
making in their chariots for Dublin along the great high road.
One of his own foster brothers was the first to recognise that it
was the High-king who was there. He was kept in view and
seen at last to enter Dá Derg's great court of hospitality.
The pirates ran their ships ashore to the south of the Liffey,
and Ingcel the Briton set off as a spy to examine the court and
the number of armed men about it; to see if it might not be
possible to surprise and plunder it during the night. On his
return he is questioned by his companions as to what he saw,
and by this simple device&mdash;familiar to all poets from Homer
down&mdash;we are introduced to the principal characters of his
court, and are shown what the retinue of a High-king consisted
of in the sixth or seventh century, about which time the
saga probably took definite shape on parchment, or in the
second or third century if we are to suppose the traits to be more
archaic than the composition of the tale. We have here a
minute account of the King and the court and the company,
with their costumes, insignia, and appearance. We see the
King and his sons, his nine pipers or wind-instrument players,
his cupbearers, his chief druid-juggler, his three principal
charioteers, their nine apprentice charioteers, his hostages the
Saxon princes, his equerries and outriders, his three judges,
his nine harpers, his three ordinary jugglers, his three cooks,
his three poets, his nine guardsmen, and his two private table
attendants. We see Dá Derg, the lord of the court, his three
doorkeepers, the British outlaws, and the king's private drink-bearers.
Here is the description of the King himself&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I saw there a couch,'<a name="FNanchor_6_571" id="FNanchor_6_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_571" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> continued Ingcel, 'and its ornamentation
was more beautiful than all the other couches of the Court, it is curtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
round with silver cloth, and the couch itself is richly
ornamented. I saw three persons on it. The outside two of them
were fair both hair and eyebrows, and their skin whiter than snow.
Upon the cheek of each was a beautiful ruddiness. Between them
in the middle was a noble champion. He has in his visage the
ardour and action of a sovereign, and the wisdom of an historian.
The cloak which I saw upon him can be likened only to the mist of
a May morning. A different colour and complexion are seen on it
each moment, more splendid than the other is each hue. I saw in
the cloak in front of him a wheel broach of gold, that reaches from
his chin to his waist. Like unto the sheen of burnished gold is the
colour of his hair. Of all the human forms of the world that I have
seen his is the most splendid.<a name="FNanchor_7_572" id="FNanchor_7_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_572" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I saw his gold-hilted sword laid
down near him. There was the breadth of a man's hand of the sword
exposed out of the scabbard. From that hand's breadth the man who
sits at the far end of the house could see even the smallest object by
the light of that sword.<a name="FNanchor_8_573" id="FNanchor_8_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_573" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> More melodious is the melodious sound of
that sword than the melodious sounds of the golden pipes which
play music in the royal house.... The noble warrior was asleep
with his legs upon the lap of one of the men, and his head in the
lap of the other. He awoke up afterwards out of his sleep and spake
these words&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'"I have dreamed of danger-crowding phantoms,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A host of creeping treacherous enemies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A combat of men beside the Dodder,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And early and alone the King of Tara was killed."'"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This man whom Ingcel had seen was no other than the
High-king.</p>

<p>The account of the juggler is also curious&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I saw there,' continued Ingcel, 'a large champion in the middle of
the house. The blemish of baldness was upon him. Whiter than
the cotton of the mountains is every hair that grows upon his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
He had ear-clasps of gold in his ears and a speckled white cloak
upon him. He had nine swords in his hand and nine silvery shields
and nine balls of gold. He throws every one of them up into the
air and not one falls to the ground, and there is but one of them at a
time upon his palm, and like the buzzing of bees on a beautiful day
was the motion of each passing the other.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Ferrogain [the foster brother], 'I recognise him, he
is Tulchinne, the Royal druid of the King of Tara; he is Conairè's
juggler,<a name="FNanchor_9_574" id="FNanchor_9_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_574" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a man of great power is that man.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Dá Derg himself is thus described&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I saw another couch there and one man on it, with two pages in
front of him, one fair, the other black-haired. The champion himself
had red hair and had a red cloak near him. He had crimson cheeks
and beautiful deep blue eyes, and had on him a green cloak. He
wore also a white under-mantle and collar beautifully interwoven,
and a sword with an ivory hilt was in his hand, and he supplies every
couch in the Court with ale and food, and he is incessant in attending
upon the whole company. Identify that man.'</p>

<p>"'I know that man,' said he, 'that is Da Derg himself. It was by
him the Court was built, and since he has taken up residence in it, its
doors have never been closed except on the side to which the wind
blows; it is to that side only that a door is put. Since he has taken
to house-keeping his boiler has never been taken off the fire, but
continues ever to boil food for the men of Erin. And the two who
are in front of him are two boys, foster sons of his, they are the two
sons of the King of Leinster.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Not less interesting is the true Celtic hyperbole in Ingcel's
description of the jesters: "I saw then three jesters at the
fire. They wore three dark grey cloaks, and if all the men
of Erin were in one place and though the body of the mother
or the father of each man of them were lying dead before him,
not one of them could refrain from laughing at them."</p>

<p>In the end the pirates decide on making their attack. They
marched swiftly and silently across the Dublin mountains,
surrounded and surprised the court, slew the High-king
caught there, as in a trap, and butchered most of his attendants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p>After this tale of Dá Derg come a host of sagas, all calling
for a recognition, which with our limited space it is impossible
to grant them. Of these one of the most important, though
neither the longest nor the most interesting, is the account
of the Boromean or Boru tribute, a large fragment of which
is preserved in the Book of Leinster, a MS. of about the year
1150.</p>

<p>When Tuathal or Toole, called Techtmhar, or the Possessor,
was High-king of Ireland, at the close of the first century,
he had two handsome daughters, and the King of Leinster
asked one of them in marriage and took and brought home to
his palace the elder as his wife. This was as it should be, for
at that time it was not customary for the younger to be married
"before the face of the elder." The Leinster men, however,
said to their king that he had left behind the better girl of the
two. Nettled at this the King went again to Tara and told
Tuathal that his daughter was dead and asked for the other.
The High-king then gave him his second daughter, with the
courteous assurance "had I one and fifty daughters they were
thine." When he brought back the second daughter to his
palace in Leinster she, like another Philomela, discovered her
sister alive and before her. Both died, one of shame the other
of grief. When news of this reached Tara steps were taken
to punish the King of Leinster. Connacht and Ulster led a
great hosting with 12,000 men into Leinster to plunder it.
The High-king too marched from Tara through Maynooth
to Naas and encamped there. The Leinstermen were at first
successful; they beat the Ultonians and killed their prince; but
at last all the invading forces having combined defeated them
and slew the bigamist king. They then levied the blood-tax,
which was as follows:&mdash;Fifteen thousand cows, fifteen thousand
swine, fifteen thousand wethers, the same number of
mantles, silver chains, and copper cauldrons, together with one
great copper reservoir to be set up in Tara's house itself, in
which would fit twelve pigs and twelve kine. In addition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
this they had to pay thirty red-eared cows with calves of the
same colour, with halters and spancels of bronze and bosses of
gold.</p>

<p>The consequences of this unfortunate tribute were to the
last degree disastrous for Ireland. The High-kings of Ireland
continued for ages to levy it off Leinster, and the Leinstermen
continued to resist. The Fenians took part in the
conflict, for they followed Finn mac Cúmhail in behalf of the
men of Leinster against their own master the High-king.
The tribute continued to be levied, off and on, during the
reigns of forty kings, whenever Leinster seemed too weak to
resist, or whenever the High-king deemed himself strong
enough to raise it: until King Finnachta at last remitted it
at the close of the seventh century, at the request of St.
Molling.<a name="FNanchor_10_575" id="FNanchor_10_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_575" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

</p>

<p>Of course the unfortunate province, thus plundered during
generations, lost in some measure its nationality, and no doubt
it was partly owing to this that it seemed more ready than any
other district to ally itself with the Danes. The great Brian
is said to have gained his title of Borumha or Boru through
his having reimposed the tribute on Leinster, but though he
conquered that province and plundered it, I am aware of no
good authority for his actually re-imposing the Boru tribute.</p>

<p>Some of the early saints' lives, too, may be considered as
belonging almost as much to historico-romantic as to hagiological
literature. From one of these, at least, we must give an
extract, so that this voluminous side of Irish literature may
not remain unrepresented. Here is a fragment of the life of
St. Ceallach [Kal-lach] which is preserved in that ample repository<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
of ecclesiastical lore the Leabhar Breac, a great vellum
manuscript written shortly after the year 1400. The story<a name="FNanchor_12_577" id="FNanchor_12_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_577" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
deals with the dispute between Guairé [Goo-&#462;r-y&#462;], a well-known
king of Connacht, and St. Ceallach, the latter of
whom had during his student life left St. Ciaran and his
studies, and thus drawn down upon himself the prediction of
that great saint that he would die by point of weapon.</p>

<p>Guairé having banished Ceallach, against whom his mind
had been poisoned by lying tongues, the fugitive took refuge in
an island in Loch Con, where he remained for a long time.
Guairé, still excited against him through the lies of go-betweens,
invited him to a feast with intent to kill him. He
refuses however to go. The King's messengers then requested
him to at least allow his four condisciples, the only ones who
had remained with him in his solitude, to go with them to the
feast, saying that they would bear the king's messages to him
when they returned. "I will neither prevent them from
going nor yet constrain them to go," answered Ceallach, the
result of which was that the four condisciples returned along
with the envoys, and the king was greatly pleased to see them
come, and meat and drink, with good welcome, were provided
for them. After this the saga proceeds.</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>DEATH OF CEALLACH.</h4>


<p>"Then a banqueting-house apart was set in order for them, and
thither for their use the fort's best liquor was conveyed. On
Guairé's either side were set two of them, and&mdash;with an eye to win
them that they might leave Ceallach&mdash;great gifts were promised to
them; all the country of Tirawley, four unmarried women such as
themselves should choose out of the province, and, with these,
horses and kine, sufficient marriage dowry for their wives (such
gifts by covenant to be secured to them), and an adequate equipment
of arms to be furnished to each one.</p>

<p>"That night they abode there, but, at the morning's meal, with
one accord they consented to kill Ceallach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thence they departed to Loch Con, and where they had left the
boat they found it, and pulling off they reached Ceallach. They
found him with his psalter spread out before him, as he said the
psalms, nor did he speak to them. When he had made an end of
his psalmody he looked at them, and marked their eyes unsteady in
their heads, and clouded with the hue of parricide.</p>

<p>"'Young men,' said Ceallach, 'ye have an evil aspect, since ye
went from me your natures ye have changed, and I perceive in you
that for King Guairé's sake ye have agreed to murder me.'</p>

<p>"Never a tittle they denied, and he went on, 'An ill design it is,
but follow now no longer your own detriment, and from me shall
be had gifts, which far beyond all Guairé's promises shall profit you.'</p>

<p>"They rejoined, 'By no means shall we do as thou wouldst have
us, Ceallach, seeing that if we acted so, not in all Ireland might we
harbour anywhere.' And, even as they spoke, at Ceallach they
drave with their spears in unison; yet he made shift to thrust his
psalter in between him and his frock. They stowed him then in the
boat amidships, two of themselves in the bow, and so gained a
landing-place. Thence they carried him into the great forest and
into the dark recesses of the wood.</p>

<p>"Ceallach said: 'This that ye would do I count a wicked work
indeed, for in Clonmacnois [if ye spared me] ye might find shelter
for ever, or should it please you to resort rather to Bláthmac and to
Dermot, sons of Aedh Sláine, who is now King of Ireland [ye would
be secure].'"</p>

<p>[<i>Then Ceallach utters a poem of twenty-four lines.</i>]</p>

<p>"'To advise us further in the matter is but idle,' they retorted,
'we will not do it for thee.'</p>

<p>"'Well then,' he pleaded, 'this one night's respite grant to me
for God's sake.'</p>

<p>"'Loath though we be to concede it, we will yield thee that,' they
said. Then they raised their swords which in their clothes they
carried hidden, and at the sight of them a mighty fear took Ceallach.
They ransacked the wood until they found a hollow oak having one
narrow entrance, and to this Ceallach was committed, they sitting
at the hole to watch him till the morning. They were so to the
hour of night's waning end, when drowsy longing came to them,
and deep sleep fell on them then.</p>

<p>"Ceallach, in trouble for his violent death, slept not at all, at
which time it was in his power to have fled had it so pleased him,
but in his heart he said that it were misbelief in him to moot evasion
of the living God's designs. Moreover, he reflected that even were
he so to flee they must overtake him, he being but emaciated and
feeble, after the Lent. Morning shone on them now, and he (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
fear to see it and in terror of his death) shut to the door, yet he said:
'to shirk God's judgment is in me a lack of faith, Ciaran, my tutor,
having promised me that I must meet this end,' and as he spoke he
flung open the tree's door. The Raven called then, and the Scallcrow,
the Wren, and all the other birds. The Kite of Cluain-Eó's
yew tree came, and the red Wolf of Drum-mic-dar, the deceiver
whose lair was by the island's landing-place.</p>

<p>"'My dream of Wednesday's night last past was true,' said
Ceallach, 'that four wild dogs rent me and dragged me through the
bracken, and that down a precipice I then fell, nor evermore
came up,' and he uttered this lay:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'HAIL to the Morning, that as a flame falls on the ground; hail
to Him, too, that sends her, the Morning many-virtued, ever-new!<a name="FNanchor_13_578" id="FNanchor_13_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_578" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>"'O Morning fair, so full of pride, O sister of the brilliant Sun,

<p>"'Thou seest the guest in every dwelling, and shinest on every

<p>"'My little book with chequered page tells me that my life has not
been right. Maelcróin, 't is he whom I do well to fear; he it is

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I beheld a dream, that into a green glen they took me, four
there were that bore me thither, but methought, ne'er brought me
out again.</p>

<p>"'I beheld a dream, that to their house my condisciples brought

quaff.</p>

<p>"'O tiny Wren most scant of tail, dolefully hast thou piped

gift of life!<a name="FNanchor_14_579" id="FNanchor_14_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_579" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>"'O Maelcróin and O Maelcróin, thou hast resolved upon an unrighteous
deed, for ten hundred golden ingots Owen's son<a name="FNanchor_15_580" id="FNanchor_15_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_580" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> had ne'er

<p>"'O Maelcróin and O Maelcróin, pelf it is that thou hast taken to
betray me; for this world's sake thou hast accepted it, accepted it
for the sake of hell!</p>

<p>"'All precious things that ever I had, all sleek-coated grey horses,
on Maelcróin I would have bestowed them, that he should not do
me this treason.</p>

<p>"'But Mary's great Son up above me, thus addresses speech to me,
"Thou must leave earth, thou shalt have heaven; welcome awaits
thee, Ceallach."'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The saint is then, as soon as the morning had fully risen,
taken out of the tree by the four traitors, and put to death.
The kite and the wolf and the scallcrow tear his flesh. The
remainder of what is really a fine saga describes the hunt for
the murderers and their final death at the hands of Ceallach's
brother, who wrested for himself all the territory that Guairé
had given them, marries Guairé's daughter, and is, like Ceallach
his brother, finally himself put to death by Guairé's treachery.</p>

<p>It would be quite impossible within the limits of a volume
like this to give any adequate study of the evolution of Irish
saga. All Irish romances are compositions upon which more
or less care had evidently been bestowed, in ancient times, as
is evidenced by their being all shot through and through with
verse. These verses amount to a considerable portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
saga, often to nearly a quarter or even a third of the whole,
and Irish versification is usually very elaborate, and not the
work of any mere inventor or story-teller, but of a highly-trained
technical poet. Very few pieces indeed, and these
mostly of the more modern Fenian tales, are written in pure
prose. It may be that the reciter of the ancient sagas actually
<i>sang</i> these verses, or certainly gave them in a different tone
from the prose narrative with which he filled up the gap
between them. Whether the same man was both the
composer of the verse and the framer of the prose narrative, in
each particular story, is a difficult question to answer, but I
should think that in most cases, at least in the older saga,
incidents had been taken up by the bards and poets as themes
for their verses, for perhaps ages before they were brought
together by somebody and woven into one complete épopée
with a prose intermixture. Dr. Sullivan thought that the
Táin Bo Chuailgne was all originally written in verse, and
has his own interpretation for the account given in the curious
tale, the "Proceedings of the Great Bardic Institution," which
tells us that the story was at one time lost, and that the Bardic
Association was commanded to search for and recover it.
This, according to him, meant that the verses had been lost,
and that only a fragmentary form of it had been saved, the
gaps being filled with prose. I do not quite know how far this
is a probable suggestion, because it would appear to be reversing
the processes which produce epic poetry in other
literatures. The complete versified epic, the Iliad, the Odyssey,
the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, are indeed "the hatch and brood of time,"
embodying not the first but the <i>last</i> results of a long series of
national poetry. But to this last result, so close to them, so
easily attainable, the Irish never arrived, and hence the various
ballads that compose the books of their Red Branch Iliad, or
Fenian Odyssey, remains separate to this day, and find their
unity, if at all, only by means of a bridge of prose thrown
across from poem to poem, by men who were not poets. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
the internal development of the Irish not been so rudely
arrested by the Northmen towards the close of the eighth and
the beginning of the ninth century, there is every reason to
believe that both the Red Branch and the Fenian Cycle would
have undergone a further development and appeared in poems
of continuous verse.</p>

<p>The poems with which these sagas are intermixed are
mostly of two kinds, one kind, speeches in the form of lays,
placed in the mouths of the actors, prefaced by such words as
"and he sang," "so that he spake the lay," or the like, and
the other kind, which occurs less often, is as it were a <i>résumé</i>
in verse of what had been just told in prose. In almost every
case I should imagine that the narrative poems are the oldest,
and of them the prose is not unfrequently, as it were, an
explanation and an extension.</p>

<p>That the Irish had already made some approach to the
construction of a great epic is evident from the way in which
they attempted, from a very early date, to group a number of
minor sagas, which were evidently independent in their origin,
round their great saga the Táin Bo Chuailgne. There are
twelve minor tales which the Irish called preface-stories to the
Táin and which they worked into it by links, some of which,
at least, were evidently forged long after the story which they
were wanted to connect. Especially remarkable in this way
is the story of the metempsychosis of the two swineherds,
whose souls passed into the two bulls who occasioned the great
war of the Táin,&mdash;a story which is of a distinctly independent
origin, and which was forced to do duty as an outlying book,
as it were, of the Táin Bo Chuailgne.</p>

<p>How very great the number of Irish sagas must have been
can be conjectured from the fact that out of the list of one
hundred and eighty-seven contained in the Book of Leinster,
at least one hundred and twenty have completely disappeared,
and of the majority of the remainder we have only brief
digests, whilst very many of the ones still preserved, are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
mentioned in the Book of Leinster at all, thus proving that
the list given in that manuscript is an imperfect one. A perfect
one would have contained at the very least two hundred and
fifty prime stories and one hundred secondary ones, for this was
the number which every ollamh or chief poet was obliged,
by law, to know. The following are some of the best known
and most accessible of the earlier sagas which we have not yet
mentioned, and which do not belong to any of the greater cycles.
This list is drawn up, not according to the age of the texts
or the manuscripts which contain them, but according to the
date of the events to which they refer, and round which they
are constructed.</p>

<p>There are very few sagas, indeed, which deal with events
posterior to the eighth century, and among those which do
(like the stories about Callaghan of Cashel and the Danes, or
the Leeching of Cian's leg, which relates to the reign of Brian
Boru, or O'Donnell's Kerne, which seems as late as the
sixteenth century) there are not many whose literary merits
stand high. It is evident from this, that, apart from the poets,
almost all the genuine literary activity of Ireland centred
around the days of her freedom, and embraced a vast range of
time, from the mythical De Danann period down to the
birth of Christ, and from that to the eighth century, and that
after this period and the invasions of the Northmen and
Normans, Irish national history produced few subjects stimulating
to the national muse; so that the literary production
which still continued, though in narrower channels and in
feebler volume, looked for inspiration not to contemporaneous
history, but to the glories of Tara, the exploits of
Finn mac Cúmhail, and the past ages of Irish greatness.</p>

<p>The number of sagas still surviving, though many of them
are mere skeletons, may be conjectured from the fact that
O'Curry, in his manuscript lectures on Irish history, quotes
from or alludes to ninety different tales, all of considerable
antiquity, whilst M. d'Arbois de Jubainville, in his "Essai d'un
Catalogue de la littérature épique de l'Irlande," gives the
names of no less than about 540 different pieces.</p>

"Four Masters" add, "that the Boyne annually cast its produce ashore at
Inver Colpa. Great abundance of nuts were annually found upon the
Boyne and the Buais. The cattle were without keeping in Ireland in his
reign on account of the greatness of the peace and concord. His reign
was not thunder-producing nor stormy. It was little but the trees bent
under the greatness of their fruit." It is from Conairè the Ernaan tribes
were descended. They were driven by the Rudricians, <i>i.e.</i>, the Ultonians
of the Red Branch, into Munster, and from thence they were driven by the
race of Eber [the Mac Carthys, etc. of Munster], into the western islands.</p></div>

<h4>PRE-DANISH POETS</h4>


<p>The sagas and historic tales, and the poetry that is mingled
with them, are of far greater importance from a purely literary
point of view than any of the other known productions
during the pre-Norman period. Although in almost every
instance, I may say, their authorship is unknown, they are of
infinitely greater interest than those pieces whose authorship
has been carefully preserved. One of the first poets of renown
after St. Patrick's time was Eochaidh [Yohy], better known as
Dallán Forgaill. It is to him the celebrated "Amra," or elegy
on Columcille, whose contemporary he was, is ascribed,<a name="FNanchor_1_611" id="FNanchor_1_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_611" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
this poem in the Béarla Feni, or Fenian dialect, has come
down to us so heavily annotated that the text preserved is
the oldest miscellaneous manuscript we have, the Leabhar
na h-Uidhre, is almost smothered in glosses and explanations,
and indeed would be perfectly unintelligible without them.
The gloss and commentary is really far more interesting than
the poem, which indeed, considering the fame of Dallán,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
is very disappointing; but no doubt it derived half its importance
from being in the Fenian dialect, and hence incomprehensible
to the ordinary reader. "He wrote," says the learned
Colgan, who published at Louvain the lives of the saints which
O'Clery collected for him at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, "in the native speech, and in ancient style, several
little works which cannot in later ages be easily penetrated by
many otherwise well versed in the old native idiom and
antiquity, and hence they are illustrated by our more learned
antiquaries with scattered commentaries, and as rare monuments
of our ancient language and antiquity it is customary to
lecture on them and expound them in the schools of antiquaries
of our nation. Among these is one panegyric or
poem always held in great esteem on the praises of St.
Colomb, and entitled 'Amra Choluim cille,'" etc. Colgan
adds in a note, "I have in my possession one copy of this
work, but putting aside a few scattered commentaries which
it contains, it is penetrable to-day to only a few, and these the
most learned."</p>

<p>This obscure poem is not, so far as I can see, composed in
any metre or rhythm. It, with its gloss, is divided into seven
chapters and an introduction. Here is the comment on the
first words <i>Dia, Dia,</i> which will show better than anything
that could be written, the very high state of independent
development which the Irish poets had early attained in the
technique of their art. We must remember that the manuscript
in which we find this was copied about the year
1100, and the commentary may be much older. Irish
is indeed the only vernacular language of western Europe
where poetic technique had reached so high a perfection in the
eleventh century. Fully to see the significance of this one
must remember that the English language had not at this time
even begun to emerge. Compare this highly-developed critical
commentary with anything of the same age that Germany,
France, or Italy has to show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Dia, Dia,</i><a name="FNanchor_2_612" id="FNanchor_2_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_612" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> God, God, etc.," says the commentator, "it is why he
doubles the first word on account of the rapidity<a name="FNanchor_3_613" id="FNanchor_3_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_613" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and avidity of the
praising, as <i>Deus, Deus meus,</i> etc. But the name of that with the
Gael is 'Return-to-a-usual-sound,' for there be three similar standards
of expression with the poets of the Gaels, that is <i>re-return to a usual
sound</i>, and <i>renarration mode</i> and <i>reduplication</i>, and this is the mark
of each of them. The <i>return</i> indeed is a doubling of one word in
one place in the round, without adhering to it from that forth. The
<i>renarration</i> mode again is renarrating from a like mode; that means
the one word&mdash;to say it frequently in the round, with an intervention

<p>Here is another passage which will show the difficulty that
was found so early as the eleventh century in explaining this
Fenian dialect.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"IT IS A HARP WITHOUT A <i>ceis</i>, it is a church without an
abbot&mdash;<i>i.e., ceis</i> is a name for a small harp which is used as an
accompaniment to a large harp in co-playing; or it is a name for
the small pin which holds the cord in the wood of the harp; or for
the tacklings, or for the heavy cord. Or the <i>ceis</i> in the harp is what
holds the side part with its chords in it, as the poet said&mdash;it was
Ros<a name="FNanchor_6_616" id="FNanchor_6_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_616" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> mac Find who sang it, or Ferceirtné<a name="FNanchor_7_617" id="FNanchor_7_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_617" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the poet,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'The base-chord concealed not music from the harp of Crabtene,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until it dropped sleep-deaths upon hosts.</span><br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though sullen about his secrets was the King,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The <i>ceis</i>, or base-chord of Craftiné concealed it not.'"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This poem is an allusion to the sagas which grouped themselves
round the sons of Ugony the great and Lowry the
Mariner, who reigned about 530 years B.C.</p>

<p>In another place he quotes a poem of Finn mac Cúmhail's.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'AND SEA-COURSE'&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, he was skilful in the art of <i>renis</i><a name="FNanchor_8_618" id="FNanchor_8_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_618" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> that is
'of the sea,' or it may be <i>rian</i> that would be right in it, as Finn,
grandson of Baoisgne [Bweesgna] said&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'A tale I have for you. Ox murmurs,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A tale I have for you.'"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Another verse quoted alludes to the chess-board of Crimhthann
Nianáir, who came to the throne eleven years before the
birth of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_10_620" id="FNanchor_10_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_620" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"FECHT AFOR NIA NEM&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the time when the champion would
come, that is Columcille, for <i>nia</i> means a champion, as is said&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'The chessboard of Crimhthann, brave champion,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A small child carries it not on his arm (?)</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One man of its chessmen alone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would purchase six married couples.'"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The ancient commentator quotes, thirty-five times in all,
from various poems, in explanation of his text, including poems
ascribed to Columcille himself, and to Gráinne, the daughter
of Cormac mac Art, who eloped from Finn mac Cúmhail. He
quotes the satire made on Breas in the time of the Tuatha De
Danann, and a verse of St. Patrick (some of whose Irish
poetry is also quoted by the "Four Masters"), and a poet called
Colman mac Lenene, who was first a poet, but afterwards
became a saint, and founded the great school of Cloyne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>

<p>Dallán wrote two other Amras, one on Senan of Innis
Cathaigh, "which," remarks Colgan, "on account of antiqueness
of style and gracefulness is amongst those fond of
antiquity, always held in great esteem," and another in praise
of Conall of Inskeel in Donegal, in one grave with whom he
was buried. There has also come down to us in the same
inscrutable Fenian dialect a poem of his consisting of eighty-four
lines on the shield of Hugh, King of Oriel, which, unlike
his Amra, is in perfect rhyme and metre.<a name="FNanchor_11_621" id="FNanchor_11_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_621" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It was he who headed the bardic body when they were so
nearly banished from the kingdom, and were only saved by the
intervention of St. Columcille at the Synod of Drom Ceat
[Cat], of which more hereafter. There is a curious specimen
of his overbearing truculence in a story preserved in the same
manuscript (of about the year 1100) that has preserved his
Amra; it is headed "A Story from which it is inferred that
Mongan was Finn mac Cúmhail." The poet was stopping with
Mongan, King of Ulster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Every night the poet would recite a story to Mongan. So great
was his lore that they were thus from Halloweve till May-day.
He had gifts and food from Mongan. One day Mongan asked his
poet what was the death of Fothad Airgdech. Forgoll said he was
slain at Duffry in Leinster. Mongan said it was false. The poet
[on hearing that] said he would satirise him with his lampoons, and
he would satirise his father and his mother and his grandfather, and
he would sing [spells] upon their waters, so that fish should not be
caught in their river-mouths. He would sing upon their woods so
that they should not give fruit, upon their plains so that they should
be barren for ever of any produce.</p>

<p>"Mongan [thereupon] promised him his fill of precious things,
so far as [the value of] seven bondmaids, or twice seven bondmaids,
or three times seven. At last he offers him one-third, or one-half of
his land, or his whole land; at last [everything] save only his own
liberty with that of his wife Breóthigernd, unless he were redeemed
before the end of three days.</p>

<p>"The poet refused all except as regards his wife. For the sake of
his honour Mongan consented. Thereat his wife was sorrowful,
the tear was not taken from her cheek. Mongan told her not to be
sorrowful, help would certainly come to them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Eventually the poet is very dramatically shown to be in the
wrong.<a name="FNanchor_12_622" id="FNanchor_12_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_622" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Dallán Forgaill was succeeded in the Head Ollamhship of all
the Irish bards by his pupil Senchan Torpeist, who was equally
overbearing, and whose intolerable insolence is admirably
satirised in the story called the "Proceedings of the Great
Bardic Association." Only two poems of his have come down
to us, one being his elegy on the death of his master Dallán
Forgaill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>

<p>The next great lay poet of importance seems to have been
Cennfaeladh, who died in 678, whose verses are constantly cited
by the "Four Masters." He was originally an Ulster warrior who
was wounded in the battle of Moyrath, which was fought when
Adamnan, Columcille's biographer, was eleven years old, and
he was brought to be cured to the house of one Brian in
Tuaim Drecain, where there were three schools, one of classics,<a name="FNanchor_13_623" id="FNanchor_13_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_623" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
one of law, and one of poetry. He used to attend&mdash;apparently
during his convalescence&mdash;these various schools, and what he
heard in the day he would repeat to himself at night, so that
"his brain of forgetfulness was extracted from his head after
its having been cloven in the battle of Moyrath." "And he
put a clear thread of poetry through them, and wrote them on
flags and on tables, and he put them into a vellum book."
Hence he became a great lawyer as well as a poet, and a
considerable part of the celebrated Brehon Law Book, called
the Book of Acaill, is ascribed to him.<a name="FNanchor_14_624" id="FNanchor_14_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_624" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Angus Céile Dé<a name="FNanchor_15_625" id="FNanchor_15_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_625" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> [Kail-a Day], or the Culdee, is the next
poet of note who claims our attention. He flourished about
the year 800, and is the author of the well-known Féil&#301;rè, or
Calendar. In this work one stanza in <i>rinn áird</i> metre is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
devoted to each day of the year, in connection with the name
of some saint&mdash;an Irish one wherever possible. The Féil&#301;rè is
followed by a poem of five or six hundred lines, which with its
glosses and commentaries is probably the most extensive piece
of Old Irish poetry that we have. Whitley Stokes, who edited
it with great care, considers it to be of the tenth rather than
the late eighth or early ninth century. If so, this would leave
its authorship doubtful, but it has been shown, I think by Kuno
Meyer, that the number of deponental forms contained in it
might point to a higher antiquity than that which Whitley
Stokes allows. It has certainly been always hitherto accepted
as the work of Angus, and as it cannot well, in any case, be
more than a century or so later, we may let it stand here,
as it has always done, under his name. In the ancient and
curious Irish notes and commentary on the Féil&#301;rè we find a
great number of verses quoted from the poet-saints, and these
include St. Patrick, St. Ciaran the elder, St. Comgall with St.
Columcille his friend, St. Ité the virgin, St. Kevin of Glendaloch,
St. Ciaran of Clonmacnois, St. Molaise [Moleesha]
of Devenish (who sent Columcille to banishment), St. Mochuda
of Lismore, St. Molling, St. Fechin of Forc, St.
Aireran of Clonard, Maelruan of Tallaght, Adamnan (Columcille's
biographer), and Angus the Culdee himself, a goodly
company of priests and poets; but no one seems to have
been anything esteemed in ancient Erin unless he either
was or was reputed to be a poet! Of true poetic spirit
it contains not much, but it is a wonderful example of
technical difficulties overcome. The metre is one of the most
difficult, a six-syllable one, with dissyllabic endings. The
first stanzas, translated into the metre of the original, run
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Bless, O Christ, my speaking,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">King of heavens seven,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">BRIGHTLY out of heaven."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Saltair na Rann has also been usually ascribed to
Angus, but it can hardly be, as Dr. Whitley Stokes has shown,
earlier than the year 1000,<a name="FNanchor_17_627" id="FNanchor_17_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_627" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> for it mentions apparently as contemporaries
Brian king of Munster, and Dub-da-lethe archbishop
of Armagh, appointed in 988. It is a collection of one
hundred and sixty-two poems in early Middle Irish containing
between eight and nine thousand lines, mostly composed in
Deibhidh [D'yevvee] metre. These poems are all of a more
or less religious cast, and most of them are based (like the
Saxon Caedmon's) on Old Testament history, but they also
contain a prodigious deal of curious matter. The opening
poem begins&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Mo rí-se rí nime náir."<a name="FNanchor_18_628" id="FNanchor_18_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_628" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">("My king is the King of noble Heaven.")</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>It tells of the creation of the world, of the sun, of heaven
and earth, light and darkness, day and night, of how the earth
separated from the primal material, and was surrounded by the
firmament, the world being "like an apple, goodly and round";
then the king created the mists, the current of the cold watery
air, the four chief winds, and the eight sub-winds, with their
colours, "the white, the clear purple, the blue, the great green,
the yellow, the red truly-bold, ... the black, the grey,
the speckled (?), the dark (?), the dull-black, the dun-coloured."<a name="FNanchor_19_629" id="FNanchor_19_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_629" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The poet then discusses the distance from the
earth to the firmament, the seven planets, the distance from the
earth to the moon, from moon to sun, the windless ethereal
heaven, the distance between the firmament and the sun, the
motionless Olympus or third heaven, the distance from the
firmament to heaven and from the earth to the depths of hell,
the five zones, the firmament round the earth, like its shell
round an egg, the seventy-two windows of the firmament,
with a shutter on each, the seventh heaven revolving like a
wheel, with the seven planets from the creation, the signs of
the zodiac,<a name="FNanchor_20_630" id="FNanchor_20_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_630" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the time (30 days 10½ hours) that the sun is in
each, the day of the month on which it enters each, the month
in which it is in each, the division of the firmament into twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
parts, and the five things which every intelligent man should
know&mdash;the day of the month, age of the moon, height of the
tide, day of the week, and saints' festivals!<a name="FNanchor_21_631" id="FNanchor_21_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_631" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The attribution of colours to the winds in this poem is
curious and appears to be Irish. I have met traces of this
fancy even amongst the modern peasantry. There is a strange
entry in the Great Brehon Law Book, the Seanchas Mór,
which quotes the colours of the winds in the same order.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The colour of each," says this strange passage, "differs from the
other, namely, the white and the crimson, the blue<a name="FNanchor_22_632" id="FNanchor_22_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_632" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and the green,
the yellow and the red, the black and the grey, the speckled and the
dark, the <i>ciar</i> (dull black) and the grisly. From the east comes the
crimson wind, from the south the white, from the north the black,
from the west the dun. The red and the yellow winds are produced
between the white and the crimson, the green and the grey between
the grisly and the white, the grey and the <i>ciar</i> between the grisly
and the jet-black, the dark and the mottled between the black and
the crimson. And those are all the sub-winds contained in each and
all the cardinal winds."</p></blockquote>

<p>After thus describing the creation of the world in the first
poem, we are introduced in subsequent ones to heaven and the
angels, who are named for us, and then shown hell and
Lucifer's abode, the description of which, except that it is in
verse, reminds us of that given by St. Brendan. Next we are
introduced to Adam and Eve, and it is stated that Adam had
spent a thousand years in the Garden of Eden. The jealousy
of Lucifer is described, and his temptation of Eve, whom he
persuades to open the door and let him into the garden.
Then he makes her eat the apple, and Adam takes half from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
her and eats also. The eleventh poem describes the evil
result, and is quite Miltonic and imaginative. It tells us
how for a week, after being driven out, Adam and his wife
remain without fire, house, drink, food, or clothing. He then
begins to lament to Eve over all his lost blessings and admits
that he has done wrong. Thereupon Eve asks Adam to kill
her, so that God may pity him the more. Adam refuses.
He goes forth in his starvation to seek food, and finds nothing
but herbs, the food of the lawless beasts. He proposes then to
Eve to do penance and adore God in silence, Eve in the
Tigris for thirty days, and Adam in the Jordan for forty-seven
days, a flagstone under their feet and the water up to their
necks. Eve's hair fell dishevelled round her and her eyes were
directed to heaven in silent prayer for forgiveness. Then
Adam prays the river Jordan "to fast with him against God,
with all its many beasts, that pardon may be granted to him."
Then the stream ceased to flow, and gathered together every
living creature that was in it, and they all supplicate the
angelic host to join with them in beseeching God to forgive
Adam. They obtain their request, and forgiveness is granted
to Adam and to all his seed except the unrighteous. When
the devil, however, hears this, he, "like a man in the shape of
a white angel," goes to Eve as she stands in the Tigris, and
gets her to leave her penance, saying that he had been sent by
God. They then go to Adam, who at once recognises the
devil, and shows Eve how she has been deceived. Eve falls
half dead to the ground and reproaches Lucifer. He, however,
defends himself, and repeats to them at length the story of his
expulsion from heaven for refusing to worship Adam. He
concludes by threatening vengeance on him and his descendants.
Adam and his wife then live alone for a year on grass,
without fire, house, music, or raiment, drinking water from
their palms, and eating green herbs in the shadows of trees and
in caverns. Eve brings forth a beautiful boy, who at once
proceeds to cut grass for his father, who calls him Cain. God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
at last pities Adam and sends Michael to him with various
seeds, and Michael teaches him husbandry and the use of
animals. Seven years afterwards Eve brings forth Abel. In
a vision she sees Cain drinking the blood of Abel.</p>

<p>In this manner, with a free play of the imagination, the
writer runs through both Old and New Testaments, down to
the denial of Peter and the death of Christ, in 150 poems, to
which are appended twelve more, eleven of them in a different
and more melodious metre, "rannaigheacht mhór," on the resurrection.</p>

<p>There were a number of other pre-Danish poets, but only
occasional pieces of theirs have been preserved. Their obits are
often mentioned by the annalists, but the few longer pieces of
theirs that have survived to our day being mostly historical or
genealogical, and as such devoid of much literary interest, we
may neglect them.</p>

for he has the following note: "Forgoll seems to have been an overbearing

the story synchronises with the life of Dallán Forgaill, and there is, so far

<h4>THE DANISH PERIOD</h4>


<p>The first onfall of the Danes seems to have been made about
the year 795, and for considerably over two centuries Erin was
shaken from shore to shore with ever-recurring alarms, and for
many years every centre of population lived in a state of terror,
not knowing what a day might bring forth. Monasteries and
colleges were burnt again and again, and built again and
again, only to be reburnt. Numbers of invaluable books were
destroyed, gold and silver work was carried off in quantities,
and a state of unrest produced, which must have made learning
in many parts of the island well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>Strange to say, despite the troubled condition of Ireland
during these two or three centuries, she produced a large
number of poets and scholars, the impulse given by the
enthusiasm of the sixth and seventh centuries being still strong
upon her. Unquestionably the greatest name amongst her
men of learning during this period is that of the statesman,
ecclesiastic, poet and scholar, Cormac mac Culinan, who
was at once king and bishop of Cashel,<a name="FNanchor_1_633" id="FNanchor_1_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_633" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
striking figures in both the literary and political history of
these centuries.</p>

<p>To him we owe that valuable compilation, so often quoted
already under the title of "Cormac's Glossary," which is by
far the oldest attempt at a comparative vernacular dictionary
made in any language of modern Europe.<a name="FNanchor_2_634" id="FNanchor_2_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_634" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Of course it has
been enlarged by subsequent writers, but the idea and much
of the matter remains Cormac's. In its original conception, it
was meant to explain and interpret words and phrases which
in the ninth century had become obscure to Irish scholars,
and as might be expected, it throws light on many pagan
customs, on history, law, romance, and mythology. Cormac's
other literary effort was the compilation of the Saltair of Cashel,
now most unhappily lost, but it appears to have been a great
work. In it was contained the Book of Rights,<a name="FNanchor_3_635" id="FNanchor_3_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_635" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> drawn up
for the readjustment of the relations existing between princes
and tribes, and still preserved. St. Benignus was said to have
originally composed in verse a complete statement of the
various rights, privileges, and duties of the High-king, the
provincial kings, and the local chieftains. This, like so much
of ancient and primitive law, was drawn up in verse so as to
be thus stereotyped for the future, and easily remembered at
a time when books were scarce. Cormac seems to have
enlarged, modified, and brought it up to date to suit the
changing times, and it was subsequently redacted again in
Brian Boru's day in a sense favourable to Munster.<a name="FNanchor_4_636" id="FNanchor_4_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_636" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The
king-bishop was a most remarkable man and an excellent
scholar. He appears to have known Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
and Danish, and to have been one of the finest Old Gaelic
scholars of his day, and withal an accomplished poet, though
his verses are now lost. He was slain in battle in the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
908,<a name="FNanchor_5_637" id="FNanchor_5_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_637" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> under circumstances so curiously described in the
fragmentary annals edited by O'Donovan that it may be worth
repeating here. He was, as we know from other sources,
betrothed to the Princess Gormfhlaith or Gormly, daughter of
Flann Sionna [Shinna], king of Meath and High-king of
Ireland, but determining to enter the Church he returned her
with her dowry to her father without consummating the
marriage; after this he took orders, and rose in time to be
archbishop of Cashel as well as king of Munster. Gormly,
however, was married against her will to Cearbhall [Caroll],
king of Leinster. It was in the year 908 that Flann, the
High-king, with Caroll king of Leinster, now his son-in-law,
prepared to meet Munster and to assert by arms his right to
the presentation of the ancient church of Monasterevan, but it
seems probable that he also bore the king-archbishop a grudge
for his treatment of his daughter Gormly. Here is the
annalistic account of the sequel:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>DEATH OF CORMAC MAC CULINAN.<a name="FNanchor_6_638" id="FNanchor_6_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_638" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h4>


<p>"The great host of Munster was assembled by the same two, that
is, Flaherty,<a name="FNanchor_7_639" id="FNanchor_7_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_639" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> [abbot of Scattery Island, in the Shannon], and Cormac
[mac Culinan], to demand hostages of Leinster and Ossory, and all
the men of Munster were in the same camp.... And noble ambassadors
came from Leinster from Caroll, son of Muirigan [king
of that province], to Cormac first, and they delivered a message of
peace from the Leinstermen, <i>i.e.</i>, one peace to be in all Erin until
May following (it being then the second week in autumn), and to
give hostages into the keeping of Maenach, a holy, wise, and pious
man, and of other pious men, and to give jewels and much property
to Cormac and Flaherty.</p>

<p>"Cormac was much rejoiced at being offered this peace, and he
afterward went to tell it to Flaherty and how he was offered it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
Leinster. When Flaherty heard this he was greatly horrified, and
't was what he said, 'This shows,' said he, 'the littleness of thy mind
and the feebleness of thy nature, for thou art the son of a plebeian,'
and he said many other bitter and insulting words, which it would
be too long to repeat.</p>

<p>"The answer which Cormac made him was, 'I am certain,' Cormac
said, 'of what the result of this [obstinacy of yours] will be, a battle
will be fought, O holy man,' said he, 'and [I] Cormac shall be
under a curse for it, and it is likely that it will be the cause of death
to thee [also].' And when he had said this he came into his own
tent, afflicted and sorrowful. And when he sat down he took a
basketful of apples and proceeded to divide them amongst his
people and said, 'My dear people,' he said, 'I shall never give you
apples again from this out for ever.' 'Is it so, O dear earthly lord?'
said his people; 'why art thou sorrowful and melancholy with us;
it is often thou hast boded evil for us?' 'It is,' [said Cormac,] 'as
I say, and yet, dear people, what melancholy thing have I said, for
though I should not distribute apples to you with my own hand, yet
there shall be some one of you in my place who will.' He afterwards
ordered a watch to be set, and he called to him the holy,
pious, and wise man, Maenach, son of Siadhal [Shiel], the chief co-arb
or successor of Comhghall, and he made his confession and will in his
presence, and he took the body of Christ from his hand, and he
resigned the world in the presence of Maenach, for he knew that
he would be killed in battle, but he did not wish that many others
should know it. He also ordered that his body should be brought
to Cloyne if convenient, but if not to convey it to the cemetery of
Diarmuid, [grand]son of Aedh Roin, where he had studied for a long
time. He was very desirous, however, of being interred at Cloyne
of Mac Lenin. Maenach, however, was better pleased to have him
interred at Disert Diarmada, for that was one of [Saint] Comhghall's
towns, and Maenach was Comhghall's successor. This Maenach,
son of Shiel, was the wisest man of his time, and he now exerted
himself much to make peace, if it were possible, between the men of
Leinster and Munster.</p>

<p>"Many of the forces of Munster deserted unrestrained. There
was great noise, too, and dissension in the camp of the men of Munster
at this time, for they heard that Fiann, son of Malachy [High-king
of Ireland], was in the camp of the Leinster men [helping
them] with great forces of foot and horse. It was then Maenach
said, 'Good men of Munster,' said he, 'you ought to accept of the
good hostages I have offered you to be placed in the custody of pious
men till May next, namely, the son of Caroll, king of Leinster, and
the son of the king of Ossory.' All the men of Munster were saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
that it was Flaherty [the abbot], son of Inmainên alone who compelled
them to go [to fight] into Leinster.</p>

<p>"After this great complaint which they made, they came over Slieve
Mairgé from the west to Leithglinn Bridge. But Tibraidé,
successor of Ailbhé [of Emly], and many of the clergy along with
him tarried at Leithglinn, and also the servants of the army and the
horses which carried the provisions.</p>

<p>"After this trumpets were blown and signals for battle were given
by the men of Munster, and they went forward till they came to Moy-Ailbhé.<a name="FNanchor_8_640" id="FNanchor_8_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_640" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Here they remained with their back to a thick wood awaiting
their enemies. The men of Munster divided themselves into
three equally large battalions, Flaherty, son of Inmainên, and
Ceallach, son of Caroll, king of Ossory, over the first division;
Cormac mac Culinan, king of Munster, over the middle division;
Cormac, son of Mothla, King of the Deisi, and the King of Kerry,
and the kings of many other tribes of West Munster, over the third
division. They afterwards came on in this order to Moy-Ailbhe.
They were querulous on account of the numbers of the enemy and
their own fewness. Those who were knowledgeable, that is those
who were amongst themselves, state that the Leinstermen and their
forces amounted to three times or four times the number of the men
of Munster or more. Unsteady was the order in which the men of
Munster came to the battle. Very pitiful was the wailing which was
in the battle&mdash;as the learned who were in the battle relate&mdash;the
shrieks of the one host in the act of being slaughtered and the
shouts of the other host exulting over that slaughter. There were
two causes for which the men of Munster suffered so sudden a defeat;
for Céileachar, the brother of Cingégan, suddenly mounted his
horse and said, 'Nobles of Munster,' said he, 'fly suddenly from this
abominable battle, and leave it between the clergy themselves who
could not be quiet without coming to battle,' and afterwards he
suddenly fled accompanied by great hosts. The other cause of the
defeat was: When Ceallach, son of Caroll, saw the battalion in
which were the chieftains of the King of Erin cutting down his own
battalion he mounted his horse and said to his own people, 'Mount
your horses and drive the enemy before you.' And though he said
this, it was not to really fight he said so but to fly. Howsoever it
resulted from these causes that the Munster battalion fled together.
Alas! pitiful and great was the slaughter throughout Moy-Ailbhe
afterwards. A cleric was not spared more than a layman, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
they were all equally killed. When a layman or a clergyman was
spared it was not out of mercy, it was done but out of covetousness,
to obtain a ransom from them, or to bring them into servitude.
King Cormac, however, escaped in the van of the first battalion, but
the horse leaped into a trench and he fell off it. When a party
of his people who were flying perceived this, they came to the King
and put him up on his horse again. It was then he saw a foster son
of his own, a noble of the Eoghanachts, Aedh by name, who was an
adept in wisdom and jurisprudence and history and Latin; and the
King said to him, 'Beloved son,' said he, 'do not cling by me,
but take thyself out of it as well as thou canst; I told thee
that I should be killed in this battle.' A few remained along
with Cormac, and he came forward along the way on horseback,
and the way was besmeared throughout with much blood of
men and horses. The hind feet of his horse slipped on the slippery
way in the track of blood, and the horse fell right back and [Cormac's]
back and neck were both broken, and he said, when falling,
'In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum,' and he gave
up the ghost; and the impious sons of malediction came and thrust
spears through his body, and cut off his head.</p>

<p>"Although much was the slaying on Moy-Ailbhe to the east of the
Barrow, yet the prowess of Leinster was not satiated with it, but
they followed up the rout westwards across Slieve Mairgé, and slew
many noblemen in that pursuit.</p>

<p>"In the very beginning of the battle Ceallach, son of Caroll, king
of Ossory, and his son were killed at once. Dispersedly, however,
others were killed from that out, both laity and clergy. There were
many good clergymen killed in this battle, as were also many kings
and chieftains. In it was slain Fogartach, son of Suibhne [Sweeny],
an adept in philosophy and divinity, King of Kerry, and Ailell, son of
Owen, the distinguished young sage and high-born nobleman, and
Colman, Abbot of Cenn-Etigh, Chief Ollav of the judicature of Erin,
and hosts of others also, quos longum est scribere....</p>

<p>"Then a party came up to Fiann, having the head of Cormac with
them, and 't was what they said to Fiann, 'Life and health, O powerful
victorious king, and Cormac's head to thee from us; and as is
customary with kings raise thy thigh and put this head under it and
press it with thy thigh.' Howsoever Flann spoke evil to them, it
was not thanks he gave them. 'It was an enormous act,' said he,
'to have taken off the head of the holy bishop, but, however, I shall
honour it instead of crushing it.' Fiann took the head into his hand
and kissed it, and carried thrice round him the consecrated head of
the holy bishop and martyr. The head was afterwards honourably
carried away from him to the body where Meaenach, son of Shiel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
successor of Comhghall, was, and he carried the body of Cormac to
Castledermot, where it was honourably interred, and where it performs
signs and miracles.</p>

<p>"Why should not the heart repine and the mind sicken at this enormous
deed; the killing and the mangling with horrid arms of this
holy man, the most learned of all who came or shall come of the men
of Erin for ever? The complete master in Gaedhlic and Latin, the
archbishop most pious, most pure, miraculous in chastity and prayer,
a proficient in law and in every wisdom, knowledge, and science, a
paragon of poetry and learning, a head of charity and every virtue,
a sage of education, and head-king of the whole of the two Munster
provinces in his time!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Gormly, the betrothed, but afterwards repudiated wife of
Cormac, was also a poet, and there are many pieces ascribed to
her. She was, as I mentioned, married to Caroll king of
Leinster, who was severely wounded in this battle. He was
carried home to be cured in his palace at Naas, and Gormly
the queen was constant in her attendance on him. One day,
however, as Caroll was becoming convalescent he fell to
exulting over the mutilation of Cormac at which he had been
present. The queen, who was sitting at the foot of his bed,
rebuked him for it, and said that the body of a good man had
been most unworthily desecrated. At this Caroll, who was
still confined to bed, became angry and kicked her over with
his foot in the presence of all her attendants and ladies.</p>

<p>As her father, the High-king, would do nothing for her
when she besought him to wipe out the insult, and procure her
reparation from so unworthy a husband, her young kinsman
Niall Glún-dubh, or the Black-Kneed, took up her cause,
and obtained for her a separation from her husband and restoration
of her dowry. When her husband was killed, the year
after this, by the Danes, she married Niall, who in time succeeded
to the throne as High-king of all Ireland, and who
was one of the noblest of her monarchs. He was slain in the
end by the Danes, and the monarchy passed away from the
houses both of her father and her husband, and she, the
daughter of one High-king, the wife of another, bewails in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
her old age the poverty and neglect into which she had fallen.
She dreamt one night that King Niall stood beside her, and
she made a leap forwards to clasp him in her arms, but struck
herself against the bed-post, and received a wound from which
she never recovered.<a name="FNanchor_9_641" id="FNanchor_9_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_641" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Many of her poems are lamentations on
her kinsman and husband Niall. They seem to have been
current amongst the Highland as well as the Irish Gaels, for
here is a specimen jotted down in phonetic spelling by the
Scotch Dean Macgregor about the year 1512:</p>

<p>Another poet of the ninth century was Flanagan, son of
Ceallach, king of Bregia. He is quoted by the "Four Masters."<a name="FNanchor_11_643" id="FNanchor_11_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_643" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
One poem of his, of 112 lines, on the deaths of the kings of
Ireland, is preserved in the Yellow Book of Lecan.</p>

<p>Mailmura, of Fahan, whom the "Four Masters" call a great
poet, was a contemporary of his, and wrote a poem on the
Milesian Migrations.<a name="FNanchor_12_644" id="FNanchor_12_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_644" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Several other poets lived in the ninth century, the chief
of whom was probably Flann mac Lonáin, for the "Four
Masters" in recording his death style him "the Virgil of
the Scottic race, the chief ollamh of all the Gaels, the
best poet that was in Ireland in his time." Eight of
his poems, containing about one thousand lines, have survived.
He was from the neighbourhood of Slieve Echtgé,
or Aughty, in South Connacht. One of his poems records
how Ilbrechtach the harper was travelling over these barren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
mountains along with the celebrated poet Mac Liag, and,
as they paused to rest on Croghan Head, Mac Liag surveyed
the prospect beneath him, and said, "Many a hill
and lake and fastness is in this range; it were a great topographical
knowledge to know them all." "If Mac Lonáin
were here," said the harper, "he could name them all, and
give the origin of their names as well." "Let this fellow be
taken and hanged," said Mac Liag. The harper begged
respite till next day, and in the meantime Mac Lonáin comes
up and recites a poem of one hundred and thirty-two lines
beginning&mdash;<i>Aoibhinn aoibhinn Echtgé árd</i>.</p>

<p>Amongst other things, he relates that he met a Dalcassian&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
one of Brian Boru's people from Clare&mdash;at Moy Finé
in Galway, who had just finished serving twelve months with
a man in that place, from whom he had received a cow and
a cloak for payment. On his way home to the Dalcassians
with his cloak and his cow he met the poet, and said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'Sing to me the history of my country,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is sweet to my soul to hear it.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thereupon I sang for him the poem,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor did he show himself the least loath:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All that he had earned&mdash;not mean nor meagre&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To me he gave it without deduction.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The upright Dalcassians heard of this,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They received him with honour in their assembly;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They gave to him&mdash;the noble race&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ten cows for every quarter of his own cow.'"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Mac Lonáin was the contemporary of Cormac mac Culinan,
whom he eulogises.</p>

<p>Some other poets of great note flourished during the Danish
period, such as Cormac "an Eigeas," who composed the
celebrated poem to Muircheartach, or Murtagh of the Leather
Cloaks,<a name="FNanchor_13_645" id="FNanchor_13_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_645" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> son of the Niall so bitterly lamented by Gormly, on
the occasion of his marching round Ireland, when he set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
from his palace at ancient Aileach near Derry, and returned
to it again after levying tribute and receiving hostages from
every king and sub-king in Ireland. This great O'Neill well
deserved a poet's praise, for having taken Sitric, the Danish
lord of Dublin, Ceallachan of Munster, the king of Leinster,
and the royal heir of Connacht as hostages, he, understanding
well that in the interests of Ireland the High-kingship should
be upheld, positively refused to follow the advice of his own
clan and march on Tara, as they urged, to take hostages from
Donagh the High-king. On the contrary, he actually sent
of his own accord all those that had been given him during
his circuit to this Donagh as supreme governor of Ireland.
Donagh, on his part, not to be out-done in magnanimity, returned
them again to Murtagh with the message that he, into whose
hands they had been delivered, was the proper person to keep
them. It was to commemorate this that Cormac wrote his
poem of two hundred and fifty-six lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>"A Mhuircheartaigh Mheic Néill náir</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;"><i>Ro ghabhais giallu Inse-Fáil."</i><a name="FNanchor_14_646" id="FNanchor_14_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_646" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>But the names of the poets Cinaeth or Kenneth O'Hartigan,
and Eochaidh O'Flynn, are the most celebrated amongst
those of the tenth century. Allusions to and quotations from
the first, who died in 975, are frequent, and nine or ten of his
poems, containing some eight hundred lines, have been preserved
perfect for us. Of O'Flynn's pieces, fourteen are
enumerated by O'Reilly, containing in the aggregate between
seventeen and eighteen hundred lines. In them we find in
verse the whole early and mythical history of Ireland. We
have, for instance, one poem on the invasion of Partholan;
one on the invasion of the Fomorians; another on the division
of Ireland between the sons of Partholan; another on the
destruction of the tower of Conaing and the battles between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
the Fomorians and the Nemedians; another on the journey
of the Nemedians from Scithia and how some emigrated
to Greece and others to Britain after the destruction of
Conairé's tower; another on the invasion of the sons of
Milesius; another on the history of Emania built by Cimbaeth
some three hundred years before Christ, up to its destruction
by the Three Collas in the year 331. This poet in especial
may be said to have crystallised into verse the mythic history
of Ireland with the names and reigns of the Irish kings, and
to have thrown them into the form of real history. O'Clery,
in his celebrated Book of Invasions, has drawn upon him very
largely, quoting, often at full length, no less than twelve of
his poems. Hence many people believe that he was one
of the first to collect the floating tribe-legends of very early
Irish kings, and the race-myths of the Tuatha De Danann and
their contemporaries, and that he cast them into that historical
shape in which the later annalists record them, by fitting them
into a complete scheme of genealogical history like that of the
Old Testament. But whether all these things had taken solid
shape and form before he versified them anew we cannot now
decide. According to O'Reilly and O'Curry this poet died
in 984, nine years after O'Hartigan; but M. d'Arbois de
Jubainville remarks that he has been unable to find out any
evidence for fixing upon this date.</p>

<p>A little later lived Mac Liag, whom Brian Boru elevated
to the rank of Arch-Ollamh of Erin, and who lived at his
court at Kincora in the closest relationship to him and his sons.
He has been credited&mdash;erroneously according to O'Curry&mdash;with
the authorship of a Life of Brian Boru, which unfortunately
has perished, only a single ancient leaf, in the
hand-writing of the great antiquary Mac Firbis, surviving.
Several of his poems, however, are preserved,<a name="FNanchor_15_647" id="FNanchor_15_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_647" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
between twelve and thirteen hundred lines in all, and are of
the highest value as throwing light both on the social state
and the policy of Ireland under Brian. One of his poems
gives a graphic description of the tribute of Ireland being
driven to Brian at his palace in Kincora in the present county
of Clare. The poet went out from the court to have a look
at the flocks and herds, and when he returned he said to the
King, "Here comes Erin's tribute of cows to thee, many a fat
cow and fat hog on the plain before thee." "Be they ever so
many," said the King, "they shall be all thine, thou noble
poet." Amongst the other part of the tribute which the
poet describes as coming in to Brian were one hundred and
fifty butts of wine from the Danes of Dublin, and a tun
of wine for every day in the year from the Danes of Limerick.
He describes Brian as sitting at the head of the great hall
of Kincora,<a name="FNanchor_16_648" id="FNanchor_16_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_648" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the king of Connacht sat on his right hand and
the king of Ulster on his left; the king of Tir-Eóghain
[Tyrone] sat opposite to him. At the door-post nearest
to Brian sat the king of Leinster, and at the other post
of the open door sat Donough, son of Brian, and Malachy,<a name="FNanchor_17_649" id="FNanchor_17_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_649" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
king of Meath. Murrough, the king's eldest son who died
so valiantly at Clontarf, sat in front of his father with his back
turned to him, with Angus, a prince of Meath, and the king
of Tirconnell on his left. One of his poems ends with two
complimentary stanzas to Brian Boru, his son Murrough, his
nephew Conaing, and Tadhg [Teig] O'Kelly, the king of
Ui Máine&mdash;all four of whom a short time afterwards were left
stiff and stark upon the field of Clontarf.</p>

<p>The shadow of the bloody tragedy there enacted hangs
heavily over all Mac Liag's later poems and those of his contemporaries,
and there are few more pathetic pieces in the
language than his wail over Kincora left desolate by the death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
of almost every chieftain who had gone forth from it to meet
the Danes.</p>

<p>In the same strain does Mac Gilla Keefe,<a name="FNanchor_20_652" id="FNanchor_20_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_652" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> another contemporary

he composed when in the north of Greece, whither he had
travelled in the itinerant Milesian manner on his way to try
if he could find the site of Paradise. The poem begins:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mag Liag was not at Clontarf himself, but his friend and
fellow-poet, Errard mac Coisé [C&#365;sha] was in the train of
Malachy, king of Meath, to whom he was then attached.
This poet gave Mac Liag a minute account of the battle, and
Mac Liag himself visited the spot before the slain had been
interred, as we see from another of his poems. In a kind of
dialogue between him and Mac Coisé he makes the latter relate
to him the names of the fallen, and describe the positions in
which their dead bodies were found upon the battlefield.
It is exceedingly probable that it was Mac Liag, perhaps with
Mac Coisé's aid, who compiled that most valuable chronicle
called the "Wars of the Gael with the Gaill," <i>i.e.</i>, of the Irish
with the Northmen.<a name="FNanchor_24_656" id="FNanchor_24_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_656" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This narrative bears both external and
internal evidence of its antiquity, for there is a portion of it preserved
in the Book of Leinster, a MS. of about the year 1150.
"The author," says Dr. Todd, who has edited it,<a name="FNanchor_25_657" id="FNanchor_25_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_657" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> "was either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
himself an eye-witness of the battle of Clontarf, or else compiled
his narrative from the testimony of eye-witnesses." It is edited
in 121 chapters, and is sufficiently long to fill over a hundred of
these pages. Beginning with the earliest Danish invasion at the
close of the eighth century, it traces the progress of the Northmen
in forty chapters up to the time when Mathgamhain [Mahon]
and Brian were ruling over the Dalcassians. After that the
book concerns itself chiefly with the history of Brian, describing
the deaths of his brother Mahon, and the revenge he took, and
his gradual but irregular attainment of the High-kingship, he
being the first of the race of Eber who had reached this dignity
for hundreds of years. The distress suffered by the Irish at the
hands of the white foreigners (the Norwegians) and the black
foreigners (the Danes)&mdash;who, by the way, were bitter enemies
and often fought with each other, even on Irish soil&mdash;is graphically
described. The Northmen put, says the writer,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"a king [of their own] over every territory, and a chief over every
chieftaincy, and an abbot over every church, and a steward over every
village, and a soldier in every house, so that none of the men of Erin
had power to give even the milk of his cow, or as much as the clutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
of eggs of one hen in succour or in kindness to an aged man or to a
friend, but was forced to preserve them for this foreign steward or
bailiff or soldier. And though there were but one milk-giving cow
in the house, she durst not be milked for an infant of one night, nor
for a sick person, but must be kept for the steward or bailiff or soldier
of the foreigners. And however long he might be absent from the
house his share or his supply durst not be lessened: although there
were in the house but one cow, it must be killed for the meal of one
night, if the means of supply could not be otherwise procured....</p>

<p>"In a word," continues the writer in a strain of characteristic
hyperbole, "although there were an hundred sharp, ready, cool,
never-resting, brazen tongues in each head, and a hundred garrulous,
loud-unceasing voices from each tongue, they could not recount nor
narrate, nor enumerate, nor tell, what all the Gael suffered in
common, both men and women, laity and clergy, old and young, noble
and ignoble, of hardship and of injury, and of oppression in every
house, from these valiant, wrathful, foreign, purely-pagan people.</p>

<p>"And though numerous were the oft-victorious clans of the many-familied
Erin," yet could they do nothing against the "untamed,
implacable hordes by whom that oppression was inflicted, because of
the excellence of their polished, ample, treble-heavy, trusty, glittering
corslets, and their hard, strong, valiant swords, and well-rivetted long
spears, and ready brilliant arms of valour, besides; and because of
the greatness of their achievements and of their deeds, their bravery,
their valour, their strength, their venom, and their ferocity, and
because of the excess of their thirst and their hunger for the brave,
fruitful, nobly-inhabited, smooth-plained, sweet-grassy land of Erin,
full of cataracts, rivers, bays."</p></blockquote>

<p>The book ends with the battle of Clontarf and the "return
from Fingall," <i>i.e.</i>, the march of the Dalcassians to their homes
in Munster. The death of Brian in this great battle fought on
Good Friday, the 23rd of April,<a name="FNanchor_26_658" id="FNanchor_26_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_658" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> 1014, is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<h4>DEATH OF BRIAN BORUMHA AT CLONTARF.</h4>


<p>"As for Brian, son of Cenneidigh [Kennedy], when the battalions
joined arms in the battle, his skin was spread for him, and he opened
his psalter and joined his hands, and began to pray after the battle
had commenced, and there was no one with him but his own attendant,
whose name was Latean (from whom are the O'Lateans still in
Munster.)<a name="FNanchor_27_659" id="FNanchor_27_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_659" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Brian said to the attendant, 'Look thou at the battalions
and the combat whilst I sing the psalms.' He sang fifty psalms and
fifty prayers and fifty paternosters, and after that he asked the attendant
how were the battalions. And the attendant answered, 'Mixed
and closely confronted are the battalions, and each of them has
come within the grasp of the other, and not louder on my ears would
be the echo of blows from Tomar's wood if seven battalions were
cutting it down, than the thud-blows on heads and bones and sculls
between them.' And he asked how was Murchadh's [Murrough's son's]
standard, and the attendant said, 'It stands, and many of the banners
of the Dál Cais [North Munster, <i>i.e.</i>, Brian's own men] around it,
and many heads thrown to it, and a multitude of trophies and spoils
with heads of foreigners are along with it.' 'That is good news
indeed,' said Brian.</p>

<p>"His skin cushion was readjusted beneath him, and he sang the
psalms and the prayers and the paters as before, and he again asked
the attendant how the battalions were, and the attendant answered
and said, 'There is not living on earth the man who could distinguish
one from the other, for the greater part of the hosts on each side are
fallen, and those who are alive are so covered with spatterings of
crimson blood and armour, that a man could not know his own son&mdash;they
are so intermingled.' He then asked how was Murchadh's
standard. The attendant said it was far from him, and that it passed
through the battalions westward, and was still standing. Brian said,
'The men of Erin will be well,' said he, 'so long as that standard
stands, for their courage and valour shall remain in them all, so long
as they can see that standard.'</p>

<p>"His cushion was readjusted under Brian, and he sang fifty psalms
and fifty prayers and fifty paters, and all that time the fighting continued.
After that he again asked the attendant how went the
battalions, and the attendant answered, 'It is like as if Tomar's
wood were after burning its undergrowth and young trees, and that
seven battalions had been for six weeks cutting them down, and it
with its stately trees and huge oaks still standing, just so are the
battalions on both sides, after the greater part of them have fallen leaving
but a few valiant heroes and great chieftains still standing. So are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
the battalions on both sides pierced and wounded and scattered, and
they are disorganised all round like the grindings of a mill turning
the wrong way; and the foreigners are now defeated, and Murchadh's
standard is fallen.' 'That is piteous news,' said Brian; 'by my
word,' said he, 'the generosity and valour of Erin fell when that standard
fell; and truly Erin has fallen of that, for there shall never come
after him a champion like him. And what the better were I though
I should escape this, and though it were the sovereignty of the world
I should attain, after the fall of Murchadh and Conaing and the other
nobles of the Dál Cais.'</p>

<p>"'Woe is me,' said the attendant, 'if thou wouldst take my advice
thou wouldst get thee to thy horse, and we would go to the camp and
remain there amongst the gillies, and every one who comes out
of the battle will come to us, and round us they will rally, for the
battalions are now mixed in confusion, and a party of the foreigners
have rejected the idea of retreating to the sea, and we know not who
shall come to us where we now are.'</p>

<p>"'Oh God; boy,' said Brian, 'flight becomes me not, and I myself
know that I shall not go from here alive, and what should it profit
me though I did, for Aoibheall [Eevil]<a name="FNanchor_28_660" id="FNanchor_28_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_660" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of Craig Liath [Lee-a], came
to me last night,' said he, 'and she told me that the first of my sons
whom I should see this day would be he who should succeed me in
the sovereignty, and that is Donough,<a name="FNanchor_29_661" id="FNanchor_29_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_661" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and go thou OLatean,' said he,
'and take these steeds with thee, and receive my blessing and carry
out my will after me, that is to say, my body and soul to God and to
St. Patrick, and that I am to be carried to Armagh, and my blessing
to Donough for discharging my last bequests after me, that is to say,
twelve score cows to be given to the co-arb of Patrick and the Society
of Armagh, and their own proper dues to Killaloe and the Churches of
Munster, and he knows that I have not wealth of gold or silver, but
he is to pay them in return for my blessing and for his succeeding
me. Go this night to Sord [Swords] and desire them to come to-morrow
early for my body, and to convey it thence to Damhliag of
Cianan, and then let them carry it to Lughmhagh [Loo-w&#257;, <i>i.e.</i>, Louth],
and let Maelmuiré mac Eochadha, the co-arb of Patrick and the
Society of Armagh come to meet me at Lughmhagh.'</p>

<p>"While they were engaged in this conversation the attendant perceived
a party of the foreigners approaching them. The Earl
Brodar was there and two warriors along with him.</p>

<p>"'There are people coming towards us here,' said the attendant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>

<p>"'What kind of people?' said Brian.</p>

<p>"'Blue stark-naked people,' said the attendant.</p>

<p>"'My woe,' said Brian, 'they are the foreigners of the armour, and
it is not for good they come.'</p>

<p>"While he was saying this he arose and stepped off his cushion
and unsheathed his sword. Brodar passed him by and noticed him
not. One of the three who were there and who had been in Brian's
service said '<i>Cing, Cing</i>!' said he, that is, 'This is the king.' '<i>No, no!
but príst príst</i>,' says Brodar, 'not he,' said he, 'but a noble priest.'
'By no means,' said the soldier, 'but it is the great king Brian.'
Brodar then turned round and appeared with a bright gleaming
battle-axe in his hand, with the handle set in the middle [of the head].
When Brian saw him he looked intently at him, and gave him a
sword-blow that cut off the left leg at the knee and the right leg at
the foot. The foreigner gave Brian a stroke which crushed his head
utterly, and Brian killed the second man that was with Brodar, and
they fell mutually by each other.</p>

<p>"There was not done in Erin, since Christianity&mdash;except the beheading
of Cormac mac Culinan&mdash;any greater deed than this. He was,
in sooth, one of the three best that ever were born in Erin, and one of
the three men who most caused Erin to prosper, namely, Lugh the Long-handed,
and Finn mac Cúmhail [Cool], and Brian, son of Kennedy;
for it was he that released the men of Erin and its women from the
bondage and iniquity of the foreigners and the pirates. It was he
that gained five-and-twenty battles over the foreigners, and who
killed them and banished them.... In short, Erin fell by the
death of Brian."</p></blockquote>

<p>The "War of the Gael with the Gaill" appears to me to be
a book which throws a strong light upon the genesis and value
of the historical saga of Ireland. Here is a real historical
narrative of unquestionable authority, and of the very highest
value for the history of these countries, which is contemporaneous,<a name="FNanchor_30_662" id="FNanchor_30_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_662" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
or almost so, with the events which it relates. Its
accuracy on matters of fact have been abundantly proved from
Danish as well as from Irish sources. And yet the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
account is dressed up and bedizened in that peculiarly Irish garb
which had become stereotyped as the dress of Irish history.
It contains the exaggeration, the necessary touch of the
marvellous, and above all the poetry, without which no Irish
composition could hope for a welcome.</p>

<p>First as to the exaggeration: the whole piece is full of it.
A good example is the description of the armies meeting on
Clontarf:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It will be one of the wonders of the day of judgment to relate
the description of this tremendous onset. There arose a wild,
impetuous, precipitate, furious, dark, frightful, voracious, merciless,
combative, contentious vulture, screaming and fluttering over their
heads. There arose also the Bocanachs and the Bananachs and the
wild people of the glens, and the witches and the goblins and the
ancient birds, and the destroying demons of the air and firmament,
and the feeble demoniac phantom host, and they were screaming
and comparing the valour and combat of both parties."</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader expected some traditional flourish such as this,
and the essential truth of the narrative is no whit impaired by it.</p>

<p>Nor does the miraculous episode of Dunlang O'Hartigan,
fresh from the embraces of the fairy queen, foretelling to
Murrough that he must fall, detract from the truth that he
does fall. Dunlang had promised Murrough not to abandon
him, and he appears beside him on the very eve of the battle.
Murrough gently reproaches him and says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Great must be the love and attachment of some woman for thee
which has induced thee to abandon me.' 'Alas, O King,' answered
Dunlang, 'the delight which I have abandoned for thee is greater, if
thou didst but know it, namely, life without death,<a name="FNanchor_31_663" id="FNanchor_31_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_663" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> without cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
without thirst, without hunger, without decay, beyond any delight of
the delights of the earth to me, until the judgment, and heaven after
the judgment, and if I had not pledged my word to thee I would not
have come here, and, moreover, it is fated for me to die on the day
that thou shalt die.'</p>

<p>"'Shall I receive death this day then?' said Murrough.</p>

<p>"'Thou shalt, indeed,' said Dunlang, 'and Brian and Conaing shall
receive it, and almost all the nobles of Erin, and Turlough thy son.'</p>

<p>"'That is no good encouragement to fight,' said Murrough, 'and if
we had had such news we would not have told it to <i>thee</i>, and moreover,'
said Murrough, 'often was I offered in hills, and in fairy mansions,
this world and these gifts, but I never abandoned for one night my
country nor mine inheritance for them.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Some such touch as this, of the weird and the miraculous,
the reader also expected.</p>

<p>As for poetry, the whole piece is full of it. It contains over
five hundred lines of verse, in poems attributed to Brian Boru
himself and his brother Mahon, to Maelmhuadh or Molloy, who
so treacherously slew Mahon, to the sister of Aedh Finnliath
[Finleea], king of Ireland in 869;<a name="FNanchor_32_664" id="FNanchor_32_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_664" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> to Cormac mac Culinan,
the king-bishop; to Cuan O'Lochain, a great poet who died in
1024; to Beg mac Dé the prophet, and to Columcille, his
contemporary; to Colman mac Lenin, the poet-saint; to Gilla
Mududa O'Cassidy, a poet contemporaneous with Mac Liag;
to Mac Liag himself; to Gilla Comgaill O'Slevin, inciting
O'Neill against Brian; to a poet called Mahon's blind man;
to St. Bercan the prophet; to an unnamed cleric, and to at
least six anonymous poets.</p>

<p>I have dwelt at some length upon these peculiarities of
composition, because I wish to lay stress on the fact that the
narrative form and the romantic dress in which the early history
of Ireland is preserved (through the medium of sagas) need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
detract from its substantial veracity. We can prove the minute
accuracy of the Clontarf story and there seems scarcely more
reason to doubt that of the battle of Moyrath, fought in
Adamnan's time, or possibly the <i>substantial</i> accuracy of the
battles of Cnoca, or of Moy Léana; we must, however,
remember that with each fresh redaction, fresh miraculous
agencies, and fresh verbiage were added.</p>

<p>The battle of Clontarf put an end to the dream of a Danish
kingdom in Ireland, and though numerous bodies of the
Northmen remained in their sea-coast settlements, and continued
for many years after this to give much trouble, yet it
put a stop to all further invasion from their mother country,
and once more the centres of Irish learning and civilisation
could breathe freely.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_25_657" id="Footnote_25_657"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_657"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> In the "Master of the Rolls" Series, in 1867. "That the work was
compiled from contemporary materials," says Dr. Todd, "may be proved
by curious incidental evidence. It is stated in the account given of the
Battle of Clontarf that the full tide in Dublin Bay on the day of the battle
(23rd April, 1014) coincided with sunrise, and that the returning tide at evening
aided considerably in the defeat of the enemy. It occurred to the editor,
on considering this passage, that a criterion might be derived from it to
test the truth of the narrative and of the date assigned by the Irish Annals
to the Battle of Clontarf. He therefore proposed to the Rev. Samuel
Haughton, M.D., Fellow of Trinity College, and Professor of Geology in
the University of Dublin, to solve for him this problem: 'What was the
hour of high water at the shore of Clontarf in Dublin Bay on the 23rd of
April, 1014.' The editor did not make known to Dr. Haughton the object
he had in view in this question, and the coincidence of the result obtained
with the ancient narrative is therefore the more valuable and curious."
</p>
<p>
Dr. Haughton read a paper on the mathematics of this complex and
difficult question before the Royal Irish Academy, in May, 1861, in which
he proved that the tide&mdash;a neap tide&mdash;was full along the Clontarf shore at
about 5h. 30m. a.m., and that the evening tide was full in about 5h. 55m. p.m.
"The truth of the narrative," says Dr. Todd, "is thus most strikingly established.
In the month of April the sun rises at from 5h. 30m. to 4h.30m.
The full tide in the morning therefore coincided nearly with sunrise; a
fact which holds a most important place in the history of the battle, and
proves that our author if not himself an eye-witness, must have derived his
information from those who were. 'None others,' as Dr. Haughton
observes, 'would have invented the fact that the battle began at sunrise and
that the tide was then full in. The importance of the time of tide became
evident at the close of the day, when the returned tide prevented the escape
of the Danes from the Clontarf shore to the north bank of the Liffey.'"</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_26_658" id="Footnote_26_658"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_658"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> An ancient Irish missal preserved in the Bodleian contains this petition
for the Irish king and his army, in its Litany for <i>Easter Eve</i>: "Ut regem
Hibernensium et exercitum ejus conservare digneris&mdash;ut eis vitam et
sanctitatem atque victoriam dones." If this missal is posterior to 1014 it
must have been the reminiscence of Clontarf which inspired the prayer for
the day following the battle. If the missal is older than the battle, then the
coincidence is curious. The prayer was just a day late. The same missal
mentions in its Litanies the names Patrick, Brendan, Brigit, Columba,
Finnian, Ciaran, and St. Fursa, and contains collect, secret and post communion

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h5>

<h4>FROM CLONTARF TO THE NORMAN CONQUEST</h4>


<p>Brian, semi-usurper though he was, was in every sense a great
statesman as well as a great warrior. He found almost every
seat of learning in ruins, and every town and palace in Ireland
a shattered wreck. Before he died he had gone far towards
restoring them. He rebuilt the monasteries, re-erected the
churches, refounded the schools. "He sent professors and
masters to teach wisdom and knowledge," says the history
from which we have been quoting; but the schools had been
hopelessly broken up, the scribes had perished, the books&mdash;"the
countless hosts of the illuminated books of the men of
Erin"&mdash;had been burned and "drowned." Hence he found
himself obliged to despatch his emissaries and the few men of
learning who had survived that awful time, "to buy books
beyond the sea and the great ocean, because," says the history,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"their writings and their books in every church and in every sanctuary
where they were, were burnt and thrown into water by the
plunderers from beginning to end [of their invasions], and Brian
himself gave the price of learning, and the price of books, to every
one separately who went on this service." "By him were erected
also noble churches and sanctuaries in Erin ... many works also,
and repairs were made by him. By him were erected the church
of Cell Dálua<a name="FNanchor_1_665" id="FNanchor_1_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_665" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the church of Inis Cealtra, and the round tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
of Tuam Gréine, and many other works in like manner. By him
were made bridges and causeways and high roads. By him were
strengthened also the dúns and fortresses and islands and celebrated
royal forts of Munster.... The peace of Erin was proclaimed by him,
both of churches and people, so that peace throughout all Erin was
made in his time. He fined and imprisoned the perpetrators of murders,
trespass, robbery, and war. He hanged and killed and destroyed
the robbers and thieves and plunderers of Erin.... After
the banishment of the foreigners out of all Erin and after Erin
was reduced to a state of peace, a single woman came from Torach
in the north of Erin to Clíodhna in the south of Erin, carrying a ring
of gold on a horse-rod, and she was neither robbed nor insulted."<a name="FNanchor_2_666" id="FNanchor_2_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_666" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The bardic schools began to revive again, for the bards too
had felt the full pressure of the invasion, their colleges had been
broken up, and many of themselves been slain. One aim of
the Norsemen was to destroy all learning. "It was not
allowed," writes Keating, "to give instruction in letters." ...
"No scholars, no clerics, no books, no holy relics, were
left in church or monastery through dread of them. <i>Neither
bard nor philosopher nor musician pursued his wonted profession
in the land.</i>"</p>

<p>The eleventh and twelfth centuries, however, witnessed a
great revival of art and learning. Indeed, from the reign of
Brian until the coming of the Normans, Irish metal-work,
architecture, and letters flourished wonderfully. It is from
this brief period of comparative rest that the three most
important relics of Celtic literature now in the world
date, the Leabhar na h-Uidhre, the Book of Leinster, and
the Book of Hymns. The eleventh and twelfth centuries
produced also many men of literature, including the annalist
Tighearnach who was Abbot of Clonmacnois and died in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
1088; and Dubdaléithe, Archbishop of Armagh, who died in
1065, who wrote Annals of Ireland which are now lost, but
which are quoted both in the Annals of Ulster and in the
"Four Masters." The greatest scholar, chronologist, and poet
of this period is unquestionably Flann, the <i>fear-léighinn</i> or
head-teacher of the school of Monasterboice, who died in
1056. Though he is called Flann <i>Mainstreach</i>, or Flann of
the Monastery, he was really a layman&mdash;one proof out of
many, that the schools and colleges which grew up round
religious institutions were as much secular as theological. He
composed a valuable series of synchronisms, in which he
synchronised the kings of the Assyrians, Medes, Persians,
Greeks, and the Roman emperors, with the kings of Ireland,
in parallel columns century by century, and sums up the most
important portions of his teaching in a poem of some twelve
hundred lines intended evidently as a class-book for his pupils.
A piece of more value is one which synchronises the reigns of
the Irish monarchs with those of the Irish provincial kings and
the kings of Scotland, from the time of King Laeghaire who
received St. Patrick, down to the death of Murtough O'Brien
in 1119, these later years having been completed by some
other hand.</p>

<p>No fewer than two thousand lines of Flann's poetry were
copied into the Book of Leinster less than a hundred years
after his own death, and there are nearly as many more in
other manuscripts. They are, however, though composed in
elaborate metres, anything but creative and imaginative poems.
The most of them consist of annals or history versified,
evidently with the intention of being committed to memory,
because the great ollamhs like Flann were really rather historians
and philosophers than what we call poets, and they used
their metrical art, very often though not always, to enshrine
their knowledge. There is, however&mdash;except to the historian&mdash;nothing
particularly inspiriting in a poem of 204 lines on the
monarchs of Erin and kings of Meath who are descended from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
Niall of the Nine Hostages, giving the names, length of
reign, and manner of death of each, despite the undoubted
skill with which the technical difficulties of a thorny metre
are overcome.<a name="FNanchor_3_667" id="FNanchor_3_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_667" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Some of his pieces, however, are of more
living interest, as his poem on the history of Oileach or Ailech,
the palace of the O'Neills near Derry, in which he takes us
to the time of the Tuatha De Danann, and in his poem on
the battles fought by the Kinel Owen. Indeed as O'Curry
well puts it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Many a name lying dead in our genealogical tracts and which has
found its way into our evidently condensed chronicles and annals,
will be found in these poems connected with the death or associated
with the brilliant deeds of some hero whose story we would not
willingly lose; while, on the other hand, many an obscure historical
allusion will be illustrated and many an historical spot as yet unknown
to the topographer will be identified, when a proper investigation
of these and other great historical poems preserved in the
Book of Leinster, shall be undertaken as part of the serious study of
the history and antiquities of our country."<a name="FNanchor_4_668" id="FNanchor_4_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_668" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This summing-up of O'Curry's as to the poems of Flann, is
one which may be also applied to several of his contemporaries
and successors, such as Coleman O'Seasnan who died in 1050,
one of whose poems on the kings of Emania and of Ulster
contains 328 lines; Giolla Caomhghin [Gilla Keevin], who
died in 1072, some thirteen or fourteen hundred lines of whose
poetry has been preserved; Tanaidhe O'Mulconry, who died in
1136; Giolla Moduda O'Cassidy, who died in 1143, and whose
poems, still extant, amount to nearly nine hundred lines; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
Giolla-na-naomh O'Dunn who died in 1160, and of whom we
still possess fourteen hundred verses.<a name="FNanchor_5_669" id="FNanchor_5_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_669" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The compositions of two rather earlier poets, Erard mac
Coisé [C&#365;sha] and Cuan O'Lochain possess more interest.
They died in 1023 and 1024 respectively. Mac Coisé's four
surviving poems and his prose allegory are all of great interest.
As for Cuan O'Lochain, he was chief poet of Erin in his
day, and according to Mac Echagain's "Annals of Clonmacnois"
and an entry in the Book of Leinster, he and a cleric
named Corcran were elected to govern Ireland during the
interregnum which succeeded the death of King Malachy,
who quietly reassumed, after the death of Brian Boru, the
High-kingship of which that monarch had deprived him.
This is a convincing proof of the honour attached to the office
of "ollamh of all Ireland."</p>

<p>One of O'Lochain's pieces is of special value, because it
describes and names every chief building, monument, rath,
and remarkable spot in and around Tara, both those erected
in Cormac mac Art's time and those added afterwards; both
those which were in ruins when the poet wrote, and those
which had been described by former authors from the time of
Cormac till his own.<a name="FNanchor_6_670" id="FNanchor_6_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_670" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Another poem of his is on the <i>geasa</i>
[gassa] or tabus of the king of Ireland, and on his prerogatives.
It was tabu for him to let the sun rise on him when in bed in
the plains of Tara, or for him to alight on a Wednesday on
the plain of Bregia, or to traverse the plain of Cuillenn after
sunset, or to launch his ship on the first Monday after May
Day, etc. Another is a beautiful poem on the origin of the
river Shannon, called from a lady Sinann, who ventured near
Connla's well, a thing tabu to a female&mdash;to steal the nuts of
knowledge. There grew nine splendid mystical hazel trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
around this well, and they produced the most beautiful nuts of
rich crimson colour, and as these lovely nuts, filled full with
all that was loveliest and most refined in literature, poetry, and
art, dropped off their branches into the well, they raised a
succession of red shining bubbles. The salmon at the sound
of the falling nuts darted forward to eat them and afterwards
made their way down the river, their lower side covered with
beautiful crimson spots from the effect of the crimson nuts.
Whoever could catch and eat these salmon were in their turn
filled with the knowledge of literature and art, for the power
of the nuts had to some extent passed into the fish that eat
them. These were the celebrated "eó feasa" [yo fassa], or
salmon of knowledge, so frequently alluded to by the poets.
To approach this well was tabu to a woman, but Sinann
attempted it, when the well rose up and drowned her, and
carried her body down in a torrent of water to the river which
was after her called Shannon.</p>

<p>Altogether about 1,200 lines of Cuan O'Lochain's poetry
have been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_7_671" id="FNanchor_7_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_671" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It would be useless for our purpose to go
more minutely into the history of those pre-Norman poets.
It is not the known poetry of early Irish poets which, as a
rule, is of most interest to the purely literary student, but
rather the unknown and the traditional.</p>

<p>We must now take a glance at the Irish of this later
period upon the Continent.</p>

<p>Those brilliant names in the history of European scholarship
who distinguished themselves under Charlemagne, his son, and
his grandsons, Clemens, Dicuil, and Scotus Erigena, who
all taught in the Court schools, Dungal who taught in Pavia,
Sedulius who worked in Lüttich, Fergal, or Virgil who ruled
in Salzburg, and Moengal, the teacher of St. Gall, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
not altogether without successors. It is true that Ireland's
great mission of instruction and conversion came to a close
with the eleventh century, yet for two centuries more, driven
by that innate instinct for travel and adventure which was
so strong within them, that it resembled a second nature,
we find Irish monks creating new foundations on the Continent,
especially in Germany. One of the most noteworthy
of these was a monk from the present Donegal, Muiredach mac
Robertaigh, who assumed the Latin name of Marianus Scotus,
or Marian the Irishman. In 1076 he had succeeded in establishing
an Irish monastery at Ratisbon, or, as the Germans
call it, Regensburg, the fame of which rapidly spread, and
attracted to it many of his countrymen from Ulster, so many,
that the parent monastery failed to accommodate them; and a
branch house, that of St. Jacob, was completed in 1111.
From these points Irish monks penetrated in all directions.
Frederick Barbarossa, in 1189, on his way from the Crusades,
founded even at Skribentium, in what is now Bulgaria, a
monastery with an Irish abbot. About the same time the
Irish abbots of Ratisbon are found writing to King Wratislaw
of Bohemia to facilitate the passage of their emissaries into
Poland. Under the influence of these two Irish houses, St.
James of Ratisbon and St. Jacob, quite a number of other
Irish monasteries were founded, that of Wurzburg in 1134,
Nürnberg in 1140, Constanz in 1142, St. George in Vienna
in 1155, Eichstädt in 1183, St. Maria in Vienna in 1200.</p>

<p>These Irish monks who, in the eleventh, twelfth, and
thirteenth centuries left the north of Ireland and thus planted
themselves in Germany, were, says Zimmer, worthy successors
of those apostles and scholars who laboured from the seventh
to the tenth century in France, Switzerland, and Burgundy,
"full of religious zeal, piety, sobriety, and a genuine love of
earning."<a name="FNanchor_8_672" id="FNanchor_8_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_672" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> A chronicle of the monastery of Ratisbon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
written in 1185, states that the greater part of all the existing
documents belonging to the different Irish monasteries which
sprang from it had been written by Marianus Scotus himself.
A specimen, writes Zimmer, of his beautiful script and the
remarkable rapidity of his work may be seen at the Court
Library of Vienna, where is preserved a copy of St. Paul's
Epistles in 160 sheets, written by him in 1079, between
March 23rd and May 17th. Very many of the monks&mdash;Malachias,
Patricius, Maclan, Finnian, and others&mdash;who came
to these monasteries from Ireland brought books with them
which they presented to the German monasteries. The
century which succeeded the Battle of Clontarf was the most
flourishing period of the Irish monks in Germany. In the
thirteenth century their influence visibly declines. Once the
English had commenced the conquest of Ireland the monasteries
ceased to be recruited by men of sanctity and learning,
but were resorted to by men who sought rather material
comfort and a life of worldly freedom.<a name="FNanchor_9_673" id="FNanchor_9_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_673" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The result was
that towards the end of the thirteenth and the beginning
of the fourteenth century most of the Irish establishments
in Germany came to an end, being either made over to
Germans, like of those of Vienna and Würzburg, or else
altogether losing their monastic character like that of Nuremberg.</p>

<p>As for the parent monastery, that of St. James of Ratisbon,
its fate was most extraordinary, and deserves to be told at
greater length. It had, of course, always been from its
foundation inhabited by Irish monks alone, and was known
as the Monasterium Scotorum, or Monastery of the Irishmen.
But when in process of time the word Scotus became
ambiguous, or, rather, had come to be almost exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
applied to what we now call Scotchmen,<a name="FNanchor_10_674" id="FNanchor_10_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_674" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the Scotch prudently
took advantage of it, and claimed that they, and not the Irish,
were the real founders of Ratisbon and its kindred institutions,
and that the designation <i>monasterium Scotorum</i> proved
it, but that the Irish had gradually and unlawfully intruded
themselves into all these institutions which did not belong
to them. Accordingly it came to pass by the very irony
of fate&mdash;analogous to that which made English writers of
the last century claim Irish books and Irish script as Anglo-Saxon&mdash;that
the great parent monastery of St. James of
Ratisbon was actually given up to the Scotch by Leo X.
in 1515, and all the unfortunate Irish monks there living
were driven out! The Scotch, however, do not seem to
have made much of their new abode, for though the
monastery contained some able men during the first century
of its occupation by them&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It exercised," says Zimmer, "no influence worth mentioning
upon the general cultivation of the German people of that region,
and may be considered but a small contributor towards mediæval
culture in general, for the only share the Scotch monks can really
claim in a monument like that of the Church of St. James of
Ratisbon, is the fact of their having collected the gold for its
erection from the pockets of the Germans. In comparison with
these how noble appear to us those apostles from Ireland, of
whom we find so many traces in different parts of the kingdom,
of the monks from the beginning of the seventh to the end of
the tenth century"!</p></blockquote>

<p>This monastery was finally secularised in 1860.</p>

<h4>SUDDEN ARREST OF IRISH DEVELOPMENT</h4>


<p>The semi-usurpation of Brian Boru, which broke through
the old prescriptional usage (according to which the High-kings
of Ireland had, for the preceding five hundred
years, been elected only from amongst the northern or
southern Ui Neill, that is, from the descendants of Niall of
the Nine Hostages), produced no evil effects, but much
good so long as Brian himself lived; yet his action was
destined to have the worst possible influence upon the
future of Ireland, an evil influence comparable only to that
caused by the desertion of Tara four centuries and a half
before. The High-kingship being thus thrown open, as
it were, to any Irish chief sufficiently powerful to wrest it
from the others, became an object of constant dispute and
warfare, the O'Neills kings of Ulster, the O'Conors of
Connacht, the O'Briens of Munster, and the princes of
Leinster, all contended for it, so that from the death of
Malachy, Brian Boru's successor, there was scarcely a single
High-king who was not, as the Irish annalists call it, "a
king with opposition."<a name="FNanchor_1_675" id="FNanchor_1_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_675" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Hence despite the immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
revival of art and literature which followed the defeat of the
Northmen, the country was in many ways politically
weakened, the inherent defects of the clan system accentuated,
and the land, already much exhausted by the Danish
wars,<a name="FNanchor_2_676" id="FNanchor_2_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_676" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was left open to the invasion of the Normans.</p>

<p>It was in May, 1169, that the first force of these new
invaders landed, and, aided by the incompetence of a particularly
feeble High-king, they had so thoroughly established
themselves in Ireland by the close of the century,
that they succeeded in putting an end to the Irish High-kingship,
under which Ireland had subsisted for over a
thousand years. Then began that permanent war&mdash;very
different, indeed, from what the Irish tribes waged among
themselves&mdash;which, almost from its very commencement,
<i>thoroughly arrested Irish development, and disintegrated Irish
life</i>.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that for three centuries after
the Norman Conquest Ireland produced nothing in art,
literature, or scholarship, even faintly comparable to what
she had achieved before. With the Normans came collapse;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Red ruin and the breaking up of laws,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>and all the horrors of chronic and remorseless warfare.</p>

<p>We must now examine the history of Irish art, as displayed
in metal-work, buildings, and illuminated manuscripts.</p>

<p>That peculiar class of design which Irish artists developed
so successfully in "the countless hosts of the illuminated
books of the men of Erin," is not really of Irish origin at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
all. It is not even Celtic. The late researches of M.
Solomon Reinach and others into the genuine remains of the
Celts of Gaul and the Continent have discovered in their ornamentation
scarcely a trace at all of the so-called Irish patterns.
They are in truth not Irish, but Eastern. They seem to
have started from Byzantium, spread over Dalmatia and
North Italy, and finally found their way into Ireland.
The early forms of pre-Christian Irish art show no trace
whatsoever of those peculiar interlaced patterns and convoluted
figures which are usually associated with the name
of Celtic design. The engraved patterns on the tumulus
of New Grange, dating from probably about 800<a name="FNanchor_3_677" id="FNanchor_3_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_677" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> years
before the Christian era, and the similar scribings upon
sepulchral chambers at Louchcrew, Telltown, and other places,
do not show a particle of interlaced work, but consist for the
most part of circles with rays, arrangements of concentric
circles, patterns of double and triple spirals, and lozenges.
Indeed, it is the spiral, in countless forms and applications,
which seems to have been really indigenous to the earliest
inhabitants of Ireland, and with it the interlaced and convoluted
figures of non-Irish post-Christian art became blended,
gradually driving it out. These in their turn perished, degraded
and abased by admixture with Gothic forms introduced by the
Normans, whose invasion soon put an end to the development
of all art in Ireland save that of architecture.</p>

<p>The so-called Celtic design of Ireland, with its interlaced
bands, its convolutions, its knots, its triquetras, is really a
survival of what once, starting from the East, spread over a
large portion of western and northern Europe, but which
soon died out there overwhelmed by Gothic and other
influences; whilst in Ireland, where it was applied with
far truer artistic feeling and far finer elaboration than elsewhere,
it has been preserved in countless works of stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
bronze, and parchment. A scrutiny of early Scandinavian art
and of the architectural styles of Italy known as the Latino-Barbaro
and Italo-Bizantino, with portions of the art of other
countries, have revealed traces of the so-called Celtic designs
in places and under circumstances which prove that they cannot
be&mdash;as used to be generally supposed&mdash;the work of exiled
Irishmen. Nevertheless, there is a certain individuality in the
working out of these designs when brought to perfection by
Irish hands, which sufficiently distinguishes Irish art from that
of other countries. For in Ireland the interlaced decoration
was grafted on to the more archaic and pre-Christian style.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The peculiar spirals found on these bronzes of that [pre-Christian]
time," says Miss Stokes,<a name="FNanchor_4_678" id="FNanchor_4_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_678" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "the trumpet pattern, the even
more archaic single-line spirals, zigzags, lozenges, circles, dots, are
all woven in with interlaced designs, with marvellous skill and sense
of beauty and charm of varied surface, added to which is an unsurpassed
feeling for colour where the style admits of colour, as in
enamels and illumination. Besides all this, the interlacings, taken
by themselves, gradually undergo a change in character under the
hand of an Irish artist. They become more inextricable, more
involved, more infinitely varied in their twistings and knottings, and
more exquisitely precise and delicate in execution than they are ever
seen to be on continental work, so far as my experience goes."</p></blockquote>

<p>The original pre-Christian art of the Irish Celts, that known
to Cuchulain and Conor mac Nessa and the heroes of the Red
Branch, survives only upon a few bronzes and upon the stones
of a few sepulchral mounds. The tracings upon the sepulchral
mounds are rude&mdash;though we find in some instances evidences
of designs deliberately worked out to cover a given surface&mdash;and
they mostly consist of recognisable symbols of Sun and
Fire worship. The bronze sword-sheaths of Lisnacroghera,
which are magnificent specimens of early Irish art, are a
development of these patterns, but bear no trace of that interlaced
work which was introduced with Christianity. There
are several other bronze ornaments, evidently pre-Christian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
which exhibit the same kind of designs, notably what appear
to be two horns of a radiated crown exquisitely decorated by
spiral lines in relief, and which, said Mr. Kemble, "for beauty
of design and execution may challenge comparison with any
specimen of cast bronze-work that it has ever been my
fortune to see." Miss Stokes, however, has shown that these
pieces were not cast, but repoussé, and consequently, she
writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If not the finest pieces of casting ever seen, yet as specimens of
design and workmanship they are perhaps unsurpassed. The surface
is here overspread with no vague lawlessness, but the ornament is
treated with fine reserve, and the design carried out with the precision
and delicacy of a master's touch. The ornament on the cone
flows round and upwards in lines gradual and harmonious as the
curves in ocean surf, meeting and parting only to meet again in
lovelier forms of flowing motion. In the centre of the circular
plate below&mdash;just at the point or hollow whence all these lines flow
round and upwards, at the very heart, as it might seem, of the whole
work&mdash;a crimson drop of clear enamel may be seen."</p></blockquote>

<p>These beautiful fragments are almost certainly pre-Christian,
and may even have been worn by Conairé the Great or Conor
mac Nessa. They represent a variety of design which stands
midway between the stone engravings and the art of the early
Christians. It is a remarkable fact, amply proven and universally
acknowledged, that the bronze-work of the pre-Christian
Irish was never surpassed by their post-Christian metal-work.
Indeed, while the pagan Irish are proved to have attained great
skill in the art of design, in working of metals, and especially
in the art of enamelling by various processes, the specimens of
the earliest Christian metal-work, such as St. Patrick's bell,
are exceedingly rude and barbarous&mdash;possibly because the
skilled pagan workmen did not turn their hands to such
business, and the Christian converts had themselves to do
the best they could.</p>

<p>Many of the monks, however, appear to have given themselves
up to metal-work, and reached a very high pitch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
excellence in it, as may be seen at a glance by the inspection
of such master works as the two-handed Ardagh chalice, the
cross of Cong, and numerous shrines, cúmhdachs [coodachs],
or book-cases, and croziers. The ornamental designs upon the
later Christian metal-work reached their highest perfection in
the tenth and eleventh centuries, and the work of this period
exhibits about forty different varieties of design, in which
animal forms are only sparingly used, and in which there is no
trace of foliate pattern. Indeed, these are not found in Irish
metal-work before the period of decadence in the thirteenth
century. Although the best specimens of Christian art in
metal-work belong to the tenth and eleventh centuries, we
are not to assume from this that the metal-work of the earlier
Christian artists did not keep pace with the work of the early
Christian scribes, who produced such magnificent specimens of
penmanship and colour in the seventh and eighth centuries.
They may have done so, but no relics of their work are left.
According to Dr. Petrie, few, if any, of the more distinguished
churches of Ireland were destitute of beautiful metal-work
in the shape of costly shrines at the coming of the
Norseman, as the frequent allusions in the Irish annals show;
but scarcely one of these escaped their destructive raids, and
hence the finest surviving specimens are of a much later
date than the finest surviving manuscripts,<a name="FNanchor_5_679" id="FNanchor_5_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_679" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which were
only destroyed whenever met with, but were not, like the
costly metal-work, an object of eager and unremitting
pursuit.</p>

<p>In sculpture the Irish never produced anything finer than
their tall, shapely, richly but not over-richly ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
Celtic crosses. The Ogam-inscribed stones, of which over
a couple of hundred remain, are perfectly plain and undecorative.
Some of the later inscribed tombstones (of which
some two hundred and fifty remain), contain, it is true, fine
chisel-work, but the numerous high Celtic crosses, covered
many of them with elaborate sculpture in relief, with undercutting,
and ornamented with the divergent and interlaced
spiral pattern, show the finest artistic instinct. Most of these
beautiful works of art are later than the year 900, but hardly
one is posterior to the Norman invasion, which soon put a stop
to such artistic luxuries.</p>

<p>The Irish were not a nation of builders. Most of the early
Irish houses, even at Tara, were, as we have seen, of wood. The
ordinary dwelling-house was either a cylindrical hut of wicker-work
with a cup-shaped roof, plastered with clay and thatched
with reeds, or else a quadrilateral house built of logs or of clay.
The so-called city of Royal Tara was, in fact, a vast enclosure,
containing quite a number of different raths, and houses inside
the raths. The buildings seem to have been constructed of
the timbers of lofty trees planted side by side, probably carved
into fantastic shapes upon the outside, while the inside walls
were closely interwoven with slender rods, over which a putty
or plaster of loam was smoothly spread, which, when even and
dry, was painted in bright colours, chiefly red, yellow, and
blue. The roofs were formed of smooth joists and cross-beams,
and probably thatched with rods and rushes, much in the same
manner as the houses of the peasantry to-day. The floors
appear to have been of earth, carefully hardened and beaten
down, and then covered with a coat of some kind of hard and
shiny mortar. No doubt some very fine barbaric effects were
realised in these buildings, some of which, as is evidenced by
the description of Cormac's Teach Midhchuarta, must have
been immense. There were as many as seven dúns, or raths,
round Tara, each containing within it many houses, and each
surrounded by a mound, or vallum, planted with a stockade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
like a Maori pah.<a name="FNanchor_6_680" id="FNanchor_6_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_680" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The finest house of all, painted in the
gayest colours, planted in the sunniest spot, and provided overhead
with a balcony, was reserved for the ladies of the place,
and was called the grianán [greeanawn], or sunny house.</p>

<p>Stone, however, was used in places, at a very early date,
long before the first century, as may be seen from the stone
forts of western and south-western Ireland, huge structures of
which one of the best known is Dún-Angus, in the Isle of
Arran, but there was no knowledge of mortar. Masonry was
also used occasionally by the early monks in constructing their
little clocháns, or beehive cells, and their oratories, with rounded
roofs, built without a vestige of an arch, the whole surrounded
by an uncemented stone wall, or cashel.</p>

<p>The Irish do not seem to have done much in stone-work
until the Danish invasions forced them to construct the round
towers in which to take shelter when the enemy was upon
them, saving thus their jewels, books, and shrines. The
Danes, who made rapid marches across the country, could
not burn these towers nor throw them down, nor could they
spend the time necessary to reduce them by famine, lest the
country should be roused behind them, and their retreat to
their ships cut off. The idea and form of the round tower
the Irish almost certainly derived from the East. In Lord
Dunraven's "Notes on Irish Architecture" the path of these
buildings from Ravenna across Europe and into Ireland is
distinctly shown; but while only about a score of examples
survive in the rest of Europe, Ireland alone possesses a hundred
and eighteen of these curious structures. There are three
well-marked styles of towers. The doors and windows of
the earlier ones are primitive and horizontal, but in the later
ones the rude entablature of the earlier towers has given way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
to the decorated Romanesque arch, and the beauty and number
of the arched windows is greatly increased.</p>

<p>The transition from the horizontal to the round-arched style
is shown in the Church of Iniscaltra, erected two years after
the battle of Clontarf, and many years before the true
Romanesque appeared in England. From that time till the
coming of the Normans, Irish ecclesiastical architecture&mdash;the
only kind practised, for the Irish did not live in or build castles&mdash;progressed
enormously, and several fine specimens belonging
to the twelfth century still survive.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The remains," writes Miss Stokes, "of a great number of monuments
belonging to the period between the fifth and twelfth centuries
of the Christian era, have survived untouched by the hand either of
the restorer or of the destroyer, and in them, when arranged in
consecutive series, we can trace the development from an early and
rude beginning to a very beautiful result, and watch the dovetailing,
as it were, of one style into another, till an Irish form of Romanesque
architecture grew into perfection. The form of the Irish Church
points to an original type which has almost disappeared elsewhere&mdash;that
of the Shrine or Ark, not of the Basilica."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Norman invasion, however, put a complete stop to the
natural development of Irish Romanesque, and changed the
building of churches into that of castles, in which the Irish
only copied, so far as they built at all, the pattern of the
invader.</p>

<p>The art, however, in which the Irish earliest excelled, and
in which they have really no rivals in Europe, was in that of
writing and illuminating manuscripts. The most recent
authority on the subject, Johan Adolf Brunn in his "Inquiry
into the Art of Illuminated MSS. of the Middle Ages,"
acknowledges that the fame of the Celtic school, "dating
from the darker centuries of the Middle Ages, excels that of
any of its rivals." Westwood, the great British authority,
declares that were it not for Irishmen these islands would
contain no primitive works of art worth mentioning, and
asserts that the Book of Kells is "unquestionably the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
elaborately executed manuscript of so early a date, now in
existence." Even Giraldus Cambrensis, who came in with
the early Normans, was struck dumb with admiration of the
exquisite book shown him at Kildare, which of all the miracles
with which Kildare was credited was to him the greatest.
Here, he writes, "you may see the visage of majesty divinely
impressed, on one side the mystic forms of the evangelists
having now six, now four, now two wings, on one side the
eagle, on another the calf, on one side the face of a man, on
the other of a lion, and an almost infinite quantity of other
figures.... A careless glance at the whole," he goes on to say,
"reveals no particular excellence, but if, looking closer at it, the
spectator examined the work in detail he would see how extraordinarily
subtle and delicate were the knots and lines, how
bright and fresh the colours remained, how interlaced and
bound together was the whole, so that we would feel inclined
to believe that it could hardly be a human composition but the
works of angels. In fact," writes Cambrensis, "the oftener
and closer I inspect it,<a name="FNanchor_7_681" id="FNanchor_7_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_681" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the more certain I am to be struck with
something new, with something ever more and more wonderful."
Indeed, the story ran, that such figures and such
colouring were due to no mere mortal invention, but that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
angel had appeared to the scribe in his sleep and taught him
how to make these wondrous drawings, "and thus," adds
Cambrensis, "through the revelation of the angel, the prayer of
Brigit, and the imitation of the scribe, that book was written."</p>

<p>Now Giraldus Cambrensis, as Johan Adolf Brunn observes,
"knew to perfection the master-achievements of the non-Celtic
schools of art of contemporary date," and "although referring
to a particular work of especial merit," says Brunn, "the testimony
of this mediæval writer may well be placed at the head
of an inquiry into the art in general of the Celtic illuminated
manuscripts, emphasising as it does the salient characteristics
of the style followed by this distinguished school of illumination,
its minute and delicate drawing, its brilliancy of
colouring, and, above all, that amazing amount of devoted and
patient labour, which underlies its intricate composition, and
creates the despair of any one who tries to copy them."</p>

<p>Between six and seven centuries later Westwood expresses
himself in terms not unlike those of Cambrensis, of the now
scanty remains of ancient Irish illumination&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Especially deserving of notice," he writes, "is the extreme
delicacy and wonderful precision, united with an extraordinary
minuteness of detail with which many of these ancient manuscripts
were ornamented. I have examined with a magnifying
glass the pages of the Gospel of Lindisfarne, and the Book of Kells,
for hours together, without ever detecting a false line or an irregular
interlacement; and when it is considered that many of these details
consist of spiral lines, and are so minute as to be impossible to have
been executed without a pair of compasses, it really seems a problem
not only with what eyes but also with what instruments they could
have been executed.... I counted in a small space, measuring
scarcely three quarters of an inch by less than half an inch in width,
in the Book of Armagh, not fewer than one hundred and fifty-eight
interlacements of a slender ribbon pattern formed in white lines
edged with black ones upon a black ground."<a name="FNanchor_8_682" id="FNanchor_8_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_682" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Book of Armagh, as we have seen, was written in 807,
or perhaps, as the "Four Masters" antedate at this period, in 812,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
while the Book of Kells is ascribed, according to the best
judges, to the close of the seventh century.</p>

<p>The seventh and eight centuries, before the island was
disturbed by the Danes, were the most flourishing period
of the Irish illuminator and scribe. But their schools
continued to turn out very fine work as late as the twelfth
century, and Gilbert, in his "Facsimiles of the National
Manuscripts of Ireland," states that there are perhaps no
finer specimens of minute old writing extant than those in
the margins and interlineations of a copy of the Gospels
written by Maelbrigte Ua Maelruanaigh [Mulroony], in
Armagh, in 1138, that is, seventeen years after that city
had for the last time been burnt and plundered by the
Danes.</p>

<p>Like all the other arts of civilised life, that of the illuminator
and decorative scribe was brought to a standstill by the
Norman warriors, nor do the Irish appear after this period to
have produced a single page worth the reproduction of the
artistic palæographer. The reason of this, no doubt, was that
the Irish artist in former days could&mdash;no matter how septs
fell out or warring tribes harried one another&mdash;count upon the
sympathy of his fellow countrymen even when they were
hostile. Under the new conditions caused by the Norman
settlements in each of the four provinces, he could count on
nothing, not even on his own life. All confidence was shaken,
all peace of mind was gone, the very name of so-called government
produced a universal terror, and Ireland became, to use a
graphic expression of the Four Masters, a "trembling sod."
"No words," writes Mrs. Sophie Bryant, with perfect truth,
"could describe that arrest of development so eloquently or so
lucidly as the facts of Irish art-history." "Since then" [<i>i.e.</i>, since
the Norman invasion], writes Miss Stokes, one of the highest
living authorities upon this subject, "the native character of
Ireland has best found expression in her music. No work of
purely Celtic art, whether in illumination of the sacred writings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
or in gold, or bronze, or stone, was wrought by Irish hands after
that century and as we shall now see this decay of Irish art
is reflected in the falling off" of Irish literature, which continued
languishing until the great revival which took place about the
year 1600.</p>

<h4>FOUR CENTURIES OF DECAY</h4>


<p>For four centuries after the Anglo-Norman, or more properly
the Cambro-Norman invasion, the literature of Ireland seems
to have been chiefly confined to the schools of the bards, and
the bards themselves seem to have continued on the rather cut-and-dry
lines of tribal genealogy, religious meditations, personal
eulogium, clan history, and elegies for the dead. There reigns
during this period a lack of imagination and of initiative in
literature; no new ground is broken, no fresh paths entered
on, no new saga-stuff unearthed, no new metres discovered.
There is great technical skill exhibited, but little robust
originality; great cleverness of execution, but little boldness of
conception. How closely the bards ran in the groove of their
predecessors is evident from the number of poems of doubtful
authorship, ascribed by some authorities to bards of the pre-Norman
or even Danish period, and by others to poets of the
thirteenth, fourteenth, or even fifteenth centuries, the work of
the later period being so very often both in style and language
scarcely distinguishable from the earlier which it imitates.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of these four centuries is the number
of hereditary bards of the same name and family which we find
generation after generation, each one imitating his predecessor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
and producing his inauguration odes, his eulogies, and his elegies,
for each succeeding race of chiefs and patrons.</p>

<p>This period is the post-epic, post-saga period. Probably not
one of the Red Branch stories was even materially altered
during it. Stories of the Fenian cycle, however, continued to
be propagated and improved upon, and no doubt many new
ones were invented. But there is little or no trace of the composition
of fresh miscellaneous saga, and the only poetry that
seems to have flourished beside the classic metres of the bards is
the so-called "Ossianic," a good deal of which may, perhaps,
have assumed something of its present form during this period.</p>

<p>Some attempt there was at the careful keeping of annals, but
scarcely any at writing regular history, though the fifteenth
century produced McCraith's "Exploits of Torlough," to be
noticed further on. We shall now briefly glance at this period
age by age.</p>

<p>The thirteenth century, that succeeding the coming of the
Normans, is far more barren in literature than the one which
preceded them. Only five or six poets are mentioned as
belonging to it, and their surviving poems amount to only a
few hundred lines, with the exception of those of the great
religious bard Donogha Mór O'Daly, who died in 1244 "a
poet," record the "Four Masters," "who never was and never
shall be surpassed." All his poems extant are of a religious
character. He was buried in the abbey of Boyle, in the
county of Roscommon, in which county I have heard, up to a
few years ago, verses ascribed to him repeated by more than
one old peasant. It is usually believed that he was a cleric and
abbot of the beautiful monastery of Boyle, but there is no
evidence for this, and he may have been in fact a layman.
Thirty-one poems of his, containing in all some four thousand
two hundred lines, have been preserved, and for their great
smoothness have earned for their author the not very happy
title of the Ovid of Ireland. Here is a specimen of one of his
shorter pieces, written on his unexpectedly finding himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
unable to shed a tear after his arriving at Loch Derg on a
pilgrimage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Alas, for my journey to Loch Derg, O King of the churches and
the bells; 'I have come' to weep thy bruises and thy wound, and yet
from my eye there cometh not a tear.<a name="FNanchor_1_683" id="FNanchor_1_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_683" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"With an eye that moistens not its pupil, after doing every evil, no
matter how great, with a heart that seeketh only (its own) peace,
alas! O king, what shall I do?</p>

<p>"Without sorrowfulness of heart, without softening, without contrition,
or weeping for my faults,&mdash;Patrick head of the clergy, he
never thought that he could gain God in this way.</p>

<p>"The one son of Calphurn, since we are speaking of him, 'alas! O
Virgin, sad my state!' he was never seen whilst alive without the
trace of tears in his eye.</p>

<p>"In (this) hard, narrow stone-walled (cell), after all the evil I have
done, all the pride I have felt. Alas! my pity! that I find no tear,
and I buried alive in the grave.</p>

<p>"O one-Son, by whom all were created, and who didst not shun
the death of the three thorns, with a heart than which stone is not
more hard, 'tis pity my journey to Loch Derg."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is another specimen, a good deal of which I once
heard from a poor beggarman in the County Mayo, but it is
also preserved in numerous manuscripts:</p>

<p>The fourteenth century possesses exactly the same characteristics
as the thirteenth, only the poets are more numerous.
O'Reilly mentions over a score of them whose verses amount
to nearly seven thousand lines. Of these the best known is
probably John Mór O'Dúgan of whom about 2,600 lines
survive&mdash;important rather for the information they convey than
for their poetry. His greatest, or at least his most valuable
piece, is about the tribes and territories of the various districts in
Meath, Ulster, and Connacht, on the arrival of the Normans,
and the names of the chiefs who ruled them.<a name="FNanchor_4_686" id="FNanchor_4_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_686" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In this poem
he devotes 152 lines to Meath, 354 to Ulster, 328 to
Connacht, and only 56 to Leinster, death having apparently
carried him off (in the year 1372) before he had finished his
researches into the tribes and territories of that district. But
luckily for us his younger contemporary&mdash;Gilla-na-naomh
O'Huidhrin [Heerin]&mdash;took it up and completed it,<a name="FNanchor_5_687" id="FNanchor_5_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_687" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> so that
the two poems, usually copied together, form a single piece of
1,660 lines in <i>deibhidh</i> [d'y&#277;vee] metre, which has thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
more light upon names and territories than perhaps any other
of the same extent. It is, despite the difficult and recondite
verse, a work mainly of research and not of poetry. The same
may be said of nearly all O'Dugan's poems, another of which
called the "Forus Focal," is really a vocabulary in verse of obsolete
words, which though of similar orthography have different
or even contrary meanings. It was in this century the great miscellaneous
collection called the Book of Ballymote was compiled.</p>

<p>The fifteenth century differs very little in character from the
preceding one. We find about the same number of poets with
about the same amount of verses&mdash;between six and seven thousand
lines, according to O'Reilly&mdash;still surviving, or as O'Reilly
underrates the number, probably about ten thousand lines.
The poets were now beginning to feel the rude weight of the
prosaic Saxon, and Fergal O'Daly chief poet of Corcamroe,
Maurice O'Daly a poet of Breffhy, Dermot O'Daly of
Meath, Hugh Óg Mac Curtin, and Dubhthach [Duffach]
son of Eochaidh [Yohee] "the learned," with several more,
are mentioned as having been cruelly plundered and oppressed
by Lord Furnival and the English. It was in this century
that those most valuable annals usually called the Annals
of Ulster were compiled from ancient books now lost,
by Cathal Maguire who was born in 1438. The great
collection called the Book of Lecan was copied at the
beginning of this century, and another most important work
the "Caithréim, or warlike exploits of Turlough O'Brien,"
was written about the year 1459 by John Mac Craith, chief
historian of North Munster. This though composed in a far
more exaggerated and inflated style than even the "War of
the Gael with the Gaill," which it resembles, yet gives the
most accurate account we have of the struggles of the Irish
against the English in Munster from the landing of Henry II.
till the death of Lord de Clare in 1318. It was at the very
beginning of this century the hagiographical collection called
the Leabhar Breac was made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p>The sixteenth century cannot properly be said to mark a
transition period in Irish literature, as it does in the literature
of so many other European countries. It has, indeed, left
far more numerous documents behind it than the preceding
one, but this is mainly due to the fact that less time has
elapsed during which they could be lost. Their style and
general contents differ little, until the very close of the
century, from those of their predecessors. O'Reilly chronicles
the names of about forty poets whose surviving pieces amount
to over ten thousand lines. But so many MSS. which were
in O'Reilly's time in private hands, or which, like the Stowe
MSS., were unapproachable by students, have since been
deposited in public libraries or become otherwise accessible,
that it would, I think, be safe to add at least half as much
again to O'Reilly's computation. I have even in my own
possession poems by nearly a dozen writers belonging to the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries whose names are not
mentioned at all by O'Reilly; and the O'Conor Don has
shown me a manuscript copied at Ostend, in Belgium, in
1631, for one Captain Alexander Mac Donnell, from which
O'Curry transcribed a thousand pages of poems "of which
with a very few exceptions," he writes, "no copies are known
to me elsewhere in Ireland." A considerable number of these
poems, nearly all of them unknown to O'Reilly, were composed
in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, so
that this one manuscript alone would largely swell O'Reilly's
estimate for this period.</p>

<p>Enormous quantities of books however, belonging to the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, have been lost, and are
still being lost every day. It is an accident that Friar
O'Gara's<a name="FNanchor_6_688" id="FNanchor_6_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_688" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the O'Conor Don's collection&mdash;both compiled
abroad&mdash;have escaped. If, during the middle of the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
century, a collector of poetry had gone round transcribing the
classical poems of that age, he would have found large
collections preserved in the houses of almost every scion of the
old Gaelic nobility, with scarcely an exception. On the
break-up of the houses of the Irish chiefs the archives of their
families and their manuscript libraries were lost or carried
abroad. An excellent example of what may be called tribal
poetry, such as every great Gaelic house possessed, is contained
in a manuscript in Trinity College, which a Fellow of the
last century, called O'Sullivan, luckily got transcribed for himself,
and which is now in the college library.<a name="FNanchor_7_689" id="FNanchor_7_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_689" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The collection
thus made, from about 1570 to 1615, goes under the title of
the "Book of the O'Byrnes," and contains sixty or seventy
poems made by their own family bards and by several of the
leading bards of Ireland, for the various members of the
O'Byrnes of Ranelagh near Dublin, and of the O'Byrnes
of Wicklow, who for three generations maintained their
struggle with the English, only succumbing in the beginning
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Other family records of this nature, which were once
possessed in every county by the bardic families and by the
chiefs, have perished by the score. A glance at a few typical
poems belonging to the O'Byrnes will give a good idea of the
functions of the sixteenth-century bards, and the nature of
their poems. They are composed on all kinds of subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
connected with the wars, genealogy, and history of the tribe
and its chiefs. Many are eulogiums, some warnings, some
political poems, some elegies. Here are two or three
specimens; the first a poem of fifty-six lines, by Angus
O'Daly, on the head of one of the chiefs of the clan spiked
on the battlements of Dublin.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O body which I see without a head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is the sight of thee which has withered up my strength,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Divided and impaled in Ath-cliath [Dublin],</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The learned of Banba [Ireland] will feel its loss.<a name="FNanchor_8_690" id="FNanchor_8_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_690" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who will relieve the wants of the poor?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who will bestow cattle on the learned?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O body, since thou art without a head</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is not life which we care to choose after thee."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Another poem, by John O'H&#301;ginn asks who<a name="FNanchor_9_691" id="FNanchor_9_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_691" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> will buy nine
verses from him. By his hand he swears, though high the
fame of the men of Leinster, they are all cowed now.
The O'Tooles of the once heavy gifts have consented to
the peace of the English, and till they revoke it they will
not give one white groat for twenty-marks-worth of a
poem. The Cavanaghs are as bad, the Fitzgeralds and the
O'Mores, too, are afraid of the foreigners to buy a poem.
One man alone is not obedient to foreign English custom,
Aodh [O'Byrne] son of John, the true sweetheart of the bardic
schools of the race of the plain of Conn. Except him, the
grandson of Redmond alone, the poet sees not one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
will buy his nine stanzas&mdash;or if such exist, he knows them
not.<a name="FNanchor_10_692" id="FNanchor_10_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_692" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Another poem of 180 lines by Eochaidh [Yohee] O'Hussey
is on the extreme winsomeness and beauty of a certain lady of
the O'Byrnes, Rose by name, probably the famous wife of Fiach
O'Byrne, who, poor thing, was afterwards captured by the
English in 1595 and by them burned alive in the yard of
Dublin Castle. The English statesmen who record this piece
of work in the State Papers, did not in the least understand the
civilisation or customs of Lady Rose, her bards and her clan,
and it is only at the present day that it is possible for the
scholar through the medium of the State Papers on one side
and native Irish documents on the other, to put himself <i>en rapport</i>
with both parties; it is a process both absorbing and painful.
"What is troubling the ladies of the Gael?" asks the poet,
"is it want of gold or lack of jewels, wherefore is the dear
troop downcast? Why are the queens of princely race
disquieted? Why rise they up heavy at heart? Why lie they
down discomfited? Why are their spirits troubled? It is
because one lady so excels them all, she is the troubler of the
hosts of the men of Inisfail, the one cause of the sorrow of
our ladies. Let me," adds the poet gallantly, "have the
singing of her."<a name="FNanchor_11_693" id="FNanchor_11_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_693" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Another is by Maoilsheachlainn [Malachy in English]
O'Coffey, on seeing one of the O'Byrnes' strongholds,
probably Ballinacor, occupied by a stranger.<a name="FNanchor_12_694" id="FNanchor_12_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_694" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Another by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
of the O'Mulconrys warns Fiach O'Byrne, that whether he
likes to hear it or not, the axe of the English is raised above
his head to strike him down.<a name="FNanchor_13_695" id="FNanchor_13_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_695" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The poet points to the
Leinster septs who had been exterminated or escaped destruction
by making submission, and how is Fiach to escape, and
specially how to escape treachery?</p>

<p>Another poem composed by Donough Mac Eochaidh, or
Keogh, with high political intent, is intended to bring about a
closer feeling of friendship between the sons of Fiach O'Byrne
and John son of Redmond O'Byrne, who had been alienated,
designedly, as he intimates, by a lying story propagated by a
foreigner, whereas the O'Byrnes of Ranelagh ever sought to
avoid giving offence, and no evil story calculated to increase
enmity should be believed about one by the other.<a name="FNanchor_14_696" id="FNanchor_14_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_696" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Another poet of the Mac Eochaidhs, the household bards
of the O'Byrnes, sings the generosity of Torlagh, son of
Fiacha, "their fame is the wealth of the tribe of Ranelagh,
that is the saying of every one who knows them,<a name="FNanchor_15_697" id="FNanchor_15_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_697" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the
bestowal of their jewels, that is the treasure of the tribe of
Ranelagh, of the numerous incursions." "Small is their desire
to amass treasures, nobler is the thing for which they conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
a wish; every single man of the blood of Fiach O'Bryne has
taken upon himself to distribute his riches for Fiach!"<a name="FNanchor_16_698" id="FNanchor_16_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_698" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Another poem is a splendid war-song by Angus O'Daly on
a victory of the O'Byrnes over the English. "I rejoice that
not one was left of the remnant of the slaughter but the
captive who is in hand in bondage:"<a name="FNanchor_17_699" id="FNanchor_17_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_699" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "the blaze of the
burning country makes day out of midnight for them."</p>

<p>A remarkable poet of the end of this century was another
Angus O'Daly, the Red Bard, or Angus of the Satires, as he
was called. He seems to have been employed by the English
statesmen, Lord Mountjoy and Sir George Carew, for the
deliberate purpose of satirising all the Gaelic families in the
kingdom, and those Anglo-Normans who sympathised with
them. Angus travelled the island up and down on this sinister
mission. It was indeed an evil time. The awful massacres of
Rathlin and Clanaboy in Ulster, the hideous treachery of
Mullaghmast in Leinster, the revolting deeds of Bingham in
the west, and the unspeakable horrors that followed on the
Geraldines rebellion in the south, had reduced the Irish nobles
to a condition of the direst poverty. This poverty and the
inhospitality which he connected with it&mdash;points on which the
Irish were particularly sore&mdash;were the mark at which Angus
aimed his arrows. He usually polished off each house or clan
in a single rann or quatrain. His Irish rhymes are peculiarly
happy. Here are some specimens of his satire. He says of
Thomas Fitzgerald, Knight of Glynn, that he looked so grudgingly
at him as he ate his supper that the piece half-chewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
stuck in his throat at the very sight of the other's eyes. Of
Limerick he says the only thing he was thankful for was the
bad roads which would prevent him from ever seeing it again.
Of the Fitzmaurices he says that he will neither praise them
nor satirise them, for they are just poor gentlemen&mdash;admirable
satire, and it cannot be doubted that they keenly felt
the point of it! Often, however, Angus is only abusive&mdash;thus
of Maguire of Enniskillen he says that "he is a
badger for roughness and greyness, an ape for stature and
ugliness, a lobster for the sharpness of his two eyes, a fox for
the foulness of his breath,"<a name="FNanchor_18_700" id="FNanchor_18_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_700" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> a verse in which the happiness
of the Irish rhyming carries off the poverty of the sentiment.
He harps on the blindness of the Mac Ternans,<a name="FNanchor_19_701" id="FNanchor_19_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_701" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the misanthropy
of the Mac Gillycuddy, the inborn evil of the Fitzgibbons,<a name="FNanchor_20_702" id="FNanchor_20_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_702" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
the poverty of the O'Callaghans, the bad wines of
the O'Sullivans, the decrepitude of the O'Reillys, and so on.</p>

<p>The Red Bard went on with his satires on the men of the
four provinces, with none to say him nay, until he came to
Tipperary, where he was misguided enough to satirise the
chief of the O'Meaghers, whose servant, stung out of all control,
forgot that the person of a bard was sacred, and instantly
thrust a knife into his throat, thus putting an end to him and
his satires. Angus, however, even as he died, uttered one rann
in which, for the good of his soul, he revoked all his former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
verses: "All the false judgments I have passed upon the men
of Munster I recant them; the meagre servant of the grey
Meagher has passed as much of a false judgment upon me."</p>

<p>So greatly had the literary production of Ireland passed into
the hands of the bards during the period we are now considering,
that it will be well to study the evolution of the bardic
body down to the close of the sixteenth century, in a separate
chapter.</p>

O'Donovan, in his manuscript catalogue, quotes the last two lines of the

that he did not understand the original, for one translation is as bad

common one in Roscommon, I have frequently heard it in the sense of
"chilly." The translation is, "the news which chills me."</p></div>

<h4>DEVELOPMENT OF IRISH POETRY</h4>


<p>Some of the very earliest Irish poems&mdash;of which we have
specimens in the verses attributed to Amergin, son of Milesius,
and in the first satire ever uttered in Ireland, and in many
more pieces of a like character<a name="FNanchor_1_703" id="FNanchor_1_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_703" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;appear to have been unrhymed,
and to have depended for their effect partly upon
rapidity of utterance, partly on a tendency towards alliteration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
and in some cases on a strongly-marked leaning towards dissyllabic
words.</p>

<p>Soon after the time of St. Patrick and the first Christian
missionaries, the Irish are found for certain using rhyme&mdash;how
far they had evolved it before the coming of the Latin missionaries
is a moot question. The Book of Hymns has preserved
genuine specimens of the Latin verses of Columcille and
other early saints, which either rhyme, or have a strong <i>tendency</i>
towards rhyme, though few of these early verses are found wholly
chiming on the accented syllables.<a name="FNanchor_2_704" id="FNanchor_2_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_704" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is a tremendous claim
to make for the Celt that he taught Europe to rhyme; it is a
claim in comparison with which, if it could be substantiated,
everything else that he has done in literature pales into insignificance.
Yet it has been made for him by some of the foremost
European scholars. The great Zeuss himself is emphatic
on the point; "the form of Celtic poetry,"<a name="FNanchor_3_705" id="FNanchor_3_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_705" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> he writes, "to
judge both from the older and the more recent examples
adduced, appears to be more ornate than the poetic form of any
other nation, and even more ornate in the older poems than in
the modern ones; from the fact of which greater ornateness it
undoubtedly came to pass that at the very time the Roman
Empire was hastening to its ruin, the Celtic poems&mdash;at first
entire, afterwards in part&mdash;passed over not only into the song
of the Latins, but also into those of other nations and remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
in them." In another place he remarks the advance towards
rhyme made in the <i>Latin</i> poetry of the Anglo-Saxons, and
unhesitatingly ascribes it to Irish influence. "We must
believe," he writes, "that this form was introduced among
them by the Irish, as were the arts of writing and of painting
and of ornamenting manuscripts, since they themselves in
common with the other Germanic nations made use in their
poetry of nothing but alliteration."<a name="FNanchor_4_706" id="FNanchor_4_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_706" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Constantine Nigra
expresses himself even more strongly in his edition of the
glosses in the Codex Taurinensis. He says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The idea that rhyme originated amongst the Arabs must be
absolutely rejected as fabulous.... Rhyme, too, could not in any
possible way have evolved itself from the natural progress of the
Latin language. Amongst the Latins neither the thing nor the name
existed. We first meet with final assonance or rhyme at the close of
the fourth or beginning of the fifth century in the Latin hymns of
the Milanese Church, which are attributed to St. Ambrose and St.
Augustine. The first certain examples of rhyme, then, are found on
Celtic soil and amongst Celtic nations, in songs made by poets who
are either of Celtic origin themselves or had long resided amongst
Celtic races. It is most probable that these hymns of Middle Latin
were composed according to the form of Celtic poetry which was
then flourishing, and which exhibits final assonance in all the ancient
remains of it hitherto discovered. It is true that the more ancient
Irish and British poems which have come down to us do not appear
to be of older date than the seventh or eighth century [Nigra means,
in their present form], but it must not be rashly inferred that the
Celtic races, who were always tenacious of the manners and customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
of their ancestors, had not employed the same poetic forms already,
long before, say in the earliest centuries of our era."<a name="FNanchor_5_707" id="FNanchor_5_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_707" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After arguing that the Irish rule of "Slender-with-Slender
and Broad-with-Broad," a rule which was peculiar to the Celts
alone of all the Aryan races, contained in itself the germ of
rhyme, he sums up his argument thus positively: "We must
conclude, then, that this late Latin [Romanic] verse, made up
of accent, and of an equal number of syllables, may have arisen
in a twofold way, first by the natural evolution of the Latin
language itself; or secondly, by the equally efficacious example
of neighbouring Celtic peoples, but we conclude that <i>final
assonance, or rhyme, can have been derived only from the laws of
Celtic phonology</i>."<a name="FNanchor_6_708" id="FNanchor_6_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_708" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Thurneysen, on the other hand, who has done such good
service for the study of Irish metric by his publication of the
text of the fragmentary Irish poets' books,<a name="FNanchor_7_709" id="FNanchor_7_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_709" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is of opinion that
the Irish derived their regular metres with a given number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
syllables in each line, from the Latins;<a name="FNanchor_8_710" id="FNanchor_8_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_710" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and Windisch agrees
with him in saying that the Irish verse-forms were influenced
by Latin,<a name="FNanchor_9_711" id="FNanchor_9_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_711" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> though he thinks that Thurneysen presses his theory
too far. The latter, in opposition to Zimmer,<a name="FNanchor_10_712" id="FNanchor_10_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_712" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> will not for
instance allow the genuineness of St. Fiacc's metrical life of St.
Patrick because it is in a rhymed and fairly regular metre, a
thing which, according to him, the Irish had not developed at that
early period. It seems necessary to me, however, to take into
account the peculiar prosody of the Irish, especially the <i>tour de
force</i> called <i>áird-rinn</i> used in <i>Deibhidh</i> [d'yevvee] metre, which
we find firmly established in their oldest poems,<a name="FNanchor_11_713" id="FNanchor_11_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_713" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and which
makes the rhyming word ending the second line contain a
syllable more than the rhyming word which ends the first,
while if the accent fall in the first line on the ultimate syllable
it mostly falls in the second line on the penultimate, if it falls
on the penultimate in the first line it generally falls on the
antepenultimate in the second, as&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>This peculiarly Irish feature was not borrowed from the
Latins, but is purely indigenous. The oldest books of
glosses on the Continent contain verses formed on this model.<a name="FNanchor_13_715" id="FNanchor_13_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_715" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
According to Thurneysen's theory the Irish learned how to
write rhymed verse with lines of equal syllables sometime
between, say, the year 500 and 700, but the <i>Deibhidh</i> metre
with <i>áird-rinn</i> is found in their oldest verses, bound up with
rhyme in their accurate seven-syllable lines. Why should two
of these ingredients, the rhyme and the stated number of verses
have come from the Romans when the <i>Deibhidh áird-rinn</i>
(which apparently implies rhyme) did not? Besides is it
credible, on the supposition that the pre-Christian Irish
neither counted their syllables nor rhymed, that within
less than a couple of hundred years after coming in contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
with the rude Latin verse of Augustin and Ambrose, they had
brought rhyming verses to such a pitch of perfection as we see,
in, say, the "Voyage of Bran," which according to both Kuno
Meyer and Professor Zimmer, was written in the seventh
century, the very first verse of which runs&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Cróib dind <i>abaill</i> a h-Emain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dofed <i>samaill</i> do <i>gnáthaib</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gésci findarggait <i>fora</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Abrait <i>glano</i> co <i>m-bláthaib</i>"?</span><br />
</p>

<p>The whole of this poem, too, is shot through with verses of
<i>Deibhidh</i>, and the rhymes are extraordinarily perfect.<a name="FNanchor_14_716" id="FNanchor_14_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_716" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This
at least is clear, that already in the seventh century the Irish
not only rhymed but made intricate <i>Deibhidh</i> and other
rhyming metres,<a name="FNanchor_15_717" id="FNanchor_15_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_717" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> when for many centuries after this period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
the Germanic nations could only alliterate&mdash;a thing which
though sometimes used in Irish verse is in no way fundamental
to it. In England so late as the beginning of the fifteenth
century, the virile author of the book of Piers Ploughman
used alliteration in preference to rhyme, and, indeed, down to
the first half of the sixteenth century English poets, for the
most part, exhibit a disregard for fineness of execution and
technique of which not the meanest Irish bard attached to the
pettiest chief could have been guilty. After the seventh
century the Irish brought their rhyming system to a pitch
of perfection undreamt of, even at this day, by other
nations. Perhaps by no people in the globe, at any period
of the world's history, was poetry so cultivated and, better
still, so remunerated, as in Ireland. The elaborateness of
the system they evolved, the prodigious complexity of the
rules, the subtlety and intricacy of their poetical code are
astounding.</p>

<p>The real poet of the early Gaels was the <i>filé</i> [fill&#259;]. The
bard was nothing thought of in comparison with him, and the
legal price of his poems was quite small compared with the
remuneration of the <i>filé</i>. It was the bard who seems to have
been most affected by Latin influence, and the metres which
he used seem to have been of relatively new importation.
Where the <i>filé</i> received his three milch cows for a poem the
bard only bore away a calf. The bards were divided into
two classes, the Saor and Daor bards, or the patrician and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
plebeian.<a name="FNanchor_16_718" id="FNanchor_16_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_718" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> There were eight grades in each class, one of the
many examples of the love of the Irish for minute classification,
a quality with which they are not usually credited, at least, not
in modern times. Each of these sixteen classes of bard has his
own peculiar metre or framework for his verses, and the lower
bard was not allowed to encroach on the metres sacred to the
bard next in rank.<a name="FNanchor_17_719" id="FNanchor_17_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_719" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The f&#301;lés [fill&#259;s] were, as we have said, the highest class of
poets. There were seven grades of Filé,<a name="FNanchor_18_720" id="FNanchor_18_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_720" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the most exalted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
being called an ollamh [ollav], a name that has frequently
occurred throughout this book. They were so highly esteemed
that the annalists give the obituaries of the head-ollamhs as if
they were so many princes. The course of study was originally
perhaps one of seven years. Afterwards it lasted for twelve
years or more.<a name="FNanchor_19_721" id="FNanchor_19_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_721" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> When a poet had worked his way up after at
least twelve but perhaps sometimes twenty years of study,
through all the lower degrees, and had at last attained the rank
of ollamh, he knew, in addition to all his other knowledge,
over three hundred and fifty different kinds of versification,
and was able to recite two hundred and fifty prime stories and
one hundred secondary ones. The ancient and fragmentary
manuscripts from which these details are taken, not only give
the names of the metres but have actually preserved examples
of between two and three hundred of them taken from different
ancient poems, almost all of which have perished to a line, but
they give a hint of what once existed. Nearly all the text
books used in the career of the poet during his twelve years'
course are lost, and with them have gone the particulars of a
civilisation probably the most unique and interesting in
Europe.</p>

<p>The bardic schools were at no time an unmixed blessing to
Ireland. They were non-productive in an economic sense,
and as early as the seventh century the working classes felt that
these idle multitudes constituted an intolerable drain upon the
nation's resources. Keating in his history says that at this
time the bardic order contained a third of the men of Ireland,
by which he means a third of the free clans or patricians.
These quartered themselves from November to May upon the
chiefs and farmers. They had also reached an intolerable
pitch of insolence. According to the account in the Leabhar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
Breac they went about the country in bands carrying with
them a silver pot, which the populace named the "pot of
avarice," which was attached by nine chains of bronze hung
on golden hooks, and which was suspended on the spears of
nine poets, thrust through the links at the end of the chains.
They then selected some unfortunate victim, and approached
in state his homestead, having carefully composed a poem in
his laudation. The head poet entering chanted the first verse,
and the last poet took it up, until each of the nine had recited
his part, whilst all the time the nine best musicians played their
sweetest music in unison with the verses, round the pot, into
which the unfortunate listener was obliged to throw an ample
guerdon of gold and silver. Woe to him indeed, if he refused;
a scathing satire would be the result, and sooner than endure
the disgrace of this, every one parted to them with a share of
his wealth. Aedh mac Ainmirech, the High-king of Ireland,
who reigned at the end of the seventh century&mdash;the same who
afterwards lost his life in the battle of Bolgdún in raising the
thrice cursed Boru tribute&mdash;"considering them," as Keating
puts it, "to be too heavy a burden upon the land of Ireland,"
determined to banish the whole profession. This was the
third attempt to put down the poets, who had always before
found a refuge in the northern province when expelled from
the others. But now King Aedh [Ae] summoned a great
convention of all Ireland at Drum Ceat [Cat] near Limavaddy
in the north of Ireland, to deliberate upon several
matters of national interest, of which the expulsion of the
bards was not the least important. The fate of the Bardic
Institution was trembling in the balance, when Columcille, an
accomplished bard himself as we have seen, crossed over from
Iona with a retinue of 140 clerics, and by his eloquence and
great influence succeeded in checking the fury of the exasperated
chieftains: the issue of the great convention which lasted
for a year and one month, was&mdash;so far as the bards were concerned&mdash;that
their numbers were indeed reduced, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
agreed that the High-king should retain in his service one chief
ollamh, and that the kings of the five provinces, the chiefs of
each territory, and the lords of each sub-district should all
retain an ollamh of their own. No other poets except those
especially sanctioned were to pursue the poetic calling.</p>

<p>If the bards lost severely in numbers and prestige on this
occasion they were in the long run amply compensated for it
by their acquiring a new and recognised status in the state.
Their unchartered freedom and licentious wanderings were
indeed checked, but, on the other hand, they became for the
first time the possessors of fixed property and of local stability.
Distinct public estates in land were set apart for their maintenance,<a name="FNanchor_20_722" id="FNanchor_20_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_722" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and they were obliged in return to give public instruction
to all comers in the learning of the day, after the manner of
university professors. Rathkenry in Meath, and Masree in
Cavan are particularly mentioned as bardic colleges then founded,
where any of the youth of Ireland could acquire a knowledge of
history and of the sciences.<a name="FNanchor_21_723" id="FNanchor_21_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_723" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The High-king, the provincial
kings, and the sub-kings were all obliged by law to set apart a
certain portion of land for the poet of the territory, to be held
by him and his successors free of rent, and a law was passed
making the persons and the property of poets sacred, and
giving them right of sanctuary in their own land from all the
men of Ireland. At the same time the amount of reward
which they were allowed to receive for their poems was legally
settled. From this time forward for nearly a thousand years
the bardic colleges, as distinct from the ecclesiastical ones,
taught poetry, law, and history, and it was they who educated
the lawyers, judges, and poets of Ireland.</p>

<p>As far as we can judge the bards continued to flourish in
equal power and position with the dignitaries of the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
and their colleges must have been nearly as important institutions
as the foundations of the religious orders, until the
onslaught of the Northmen reduced the country to such a state
that "neither bard, nor philosopher, nor musician," as Keating
says, "pursued their wonted profession in the land." It was
probably at this time that the carefully observed distinction
between the bard and the <i>filé</i> broke down, for in later times
the words seem to have been regarded as synonymous.</p>

<p>For some time after the Norman conquest the bardic colleges
seem to have again suffered eclipse; and, as we have seen, the
century that succeeded that invasion appears to have produced
fewer poets than any other. But the great Anglo-Norman
houses soon became Irishised and adopted Irish bards of their
own. There are many incidents recorded in the Irish annals and
many stories gathered from other sources which go to show that
the importance of the bards as individuals could not have been
much diminished during the Anglo-Norman régime. One of
them is worth recording. In the beginning of the thirteenth
century the steward of the O'Donnell went to Lisadill,<a name="FNanchor_22_724" id="FNanchor_22_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_724" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> near
Sligo, to collect rents, and some words passed between him
and the great poet Murrough O'Daly, who, unaccustomed
to be thwarted in anything, clove the head of the steward with
an axe. Then, fearing O'Donnell's vengeance, he fled to
Clanrickard and the Norman De Bourgos, and at once addressed
a poem to Richard De Burgo, son of William Fitzadelm,
in which he states that he, the bard, was used to visit
the courts of the English, and to drink wine at the hands of
kings and knights, and bishops and abbots. He tells De
Bourgo that he has now a chance of making himself illustrious
by protecting him, O'Daly of Meath, who now
throws himself on his generosity and whose poems demand
attention. As for O'Donnell, he had given him small
offence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Trifling our quarrel with the man,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Me to kill the churl,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dear God! Is this a cause for enmity?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>De Bourgo accordingly received and protected him, until
O'Donnell, coming in furious pursuit, laid waste his country
with fire and sword. Fitzadelm submitted, but passed on the
poet to the O'Briens of North Munster. But O'Donnell
again pursuing with fury, these also submitted, and secretly
dispatched the poet to the people of Limerick who received
him. O'Donnell hurried on and laid siege to the city, and its
inhabitants in terror expelled the poet once more, who was
passed on from hand to hand until he came to Dublin. But
the people of Dublin, terrified at O'Donnell's threats, sent
him away; and he crossed over into Scotland where his fame
rose higher than before, and where his poems remained so
popular that when the Dean of Lismore in Argyle jotted down
nearly four hundred years ago in phonetic spelling a number
of poems just as he heard them, they included a disproportionately
large number of this O'Daly's,<a name="FNanchor_23_725" id="FNanchor_23_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_725" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> who was afterward
known as Murrough the Scotchman. At last in return for
some fine laudatory verses upon O'Donnell he was graciously
pardoned by that chieftain and returned to his native country.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Normans not only kept bards of their own, but
some of themselves also became poets. The story of Silken
Thomas and his bard whose verses urged him on to rebellion,
is well known. It is curious, too, to find one of the Norman
Nugents of Delvin in the sixteenth century making the most
perfect classical Irish verses, lamenting his exile from Ireland,
the home of <i>his</i> ancestors, the Land of Fintan, the old Plain
of Ir, the country of Inisfail.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Loth to Leave, my <i>fain</i> eyes swim,</span><br />

</p>

<p>After a few generations the Anglo-Normans had completely
forgotten Norman-French, and as they never, with few
exceptions, learned English, they identified themselves completely
with the Irish past, so that amongst the Irish poets we
find numbers of Nugents, Englishes, Condons, Cusacks,
Keatings, Comyns, and other foreign names.</p>

<p>It was only after the Anglo-Norman government had
developed into an English one that the bards began to feel
its weight. The slaying of the Welsh bards by Edward is
now generally regarded as a political fiction. There is no
fiction, however, about the treatment meted out to the Irish
ones. The severest acts were passed against them over and
over again. The nobles were forbidden to entertain them, in
the hope that they might die out or starve, and the Act of
Elizabeth alleges one of the usual lying excuses of the Elizabethan
period: "Item," it says, "for that those rhymours by
their ditties and rhymes made to divers lords and gentlemen
in Ireland to the commendation and high praise of extortion,
rebellion, rape, ravin, and other injustice, encourage those lords
and gentlemen rather to follow those vices than to leave them,
and for making of the said rhymes rewards are given by the
said lords and gentlemen, (let) for abolishing of so heinous an
abuse, orders be taken." Orders were taken, and taken so
thoroughly that O'Brien, Earl of Thomond, obliged to
enforce them against the bards, hanged three distinguished poets,
"for which abominable, treacherous act," say the "Four
Masters," "the earl was satirised and denounced." I find
a northern bard about this time, the close of the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
century, thus lamenting the absence of his patron, Aedh [Ae]
Mac Aonghasa:&mdash;</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Spenser the poet was not slow in finding out what a power
his Irish rivals were in the land, and he at once set himself to
malign and blacken them. "There are," he writes, "amongst
the Irish a certain kind of people called bards, which are to
them instead of poets,"&mdash;the insinuation is that the bards are
not real poets!&mdash;"the which are had in so high regard and
estimation among them, that none dare displease them for
fear to run into reproach through their offence, and to be
made infamous in the mouths of all men." On which,
Eudoxus, his friend, is made to remark innocently that he
had always thought that poets were to be rather encouraged
than put down. "Yes," answers Spenser, "they should be
encouraged when they desire honour and virtue, but," he goes
on, "these Irish bards are for the most part of another mind,
and so far from instructing young men in moral discipline,
that whomsoever they find to be most licentious of life, most
bold and lawlesse in his doings, most dangerous and desperate
in all parts of disobedience and rebellious disposition, him they
set up and glorify in their rhythmes, him they praise to the
people and to young men make an example to follow."</p>

<p>The allegation that the bards praised what was licentious
is an untruth on the part of the great poet. Few English
Elizabethans, once they passed over into Ireland, seem to have
been able to either keep faith or tell truth; there was never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
such a thoroughly dishonourable race, or one so utterly devoid
of all moral sense, as the Irish "statesmen" of that period.
The real reason why Spenser, as an undertaker, blackens the
character of the Irish poets is not because their poems were
licentious&mdash;which they were not&mdash;but because, as he confesses
later on, they are "tending for the most part to the hurt of
the English or [the] maintenance of their owne lewde libertie,
they being most desirous thereof."</p>

<p>Spenser's ignorant and self-contradictory criticism on the
merits of the Irish bards has often been quoted as if it constituted
a kind of hall-mark for them! "Tell me, I pray you,"
said his friend, "have they any art in their compositions, or be
they anything wittie or wellmannered as poems should be?"</p>

<p>"Yea, truly," says Spenser, "I have caused divers of them
to be translated unto me, that I might understand them, and
surely they savoured of sweet art and good invention, but
skilled not in the goodly ornaments of poesie, yet were they
sprinkled with some pretty flowers of their natural device,
which gave good grace and comeliness unto them; the which
it is a great pity to see abused to the gracing of wickedness
and vice, which with good usage would serve to adorn and
beautify virtue."</p>

<p>The gentle poet is here almost copying the words of the
Act, which perhaps he himself helped to inspire, according to
which the bardic poems are in praise of "extortion, rebellion,
rape, ravin, and other injustice." I have, however, read
hundreds of the poems of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, but have never come across a single syllable in
laudation of either "extortion, rape, ravin, or other injustice,"
but numerous poems inciting to what the Act calls "rebellion,"
and what Spenser terms "the hurt of the English and the
maintenance of their owne lewde libertie."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would be difficult to overrate the importance of the
colleges of the hereditary bards and the influence they exercised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
in the life of the sixteenth century. They fairly
reflected public opinion, and they also helped to make it what
it was. There is a great difference between their poems and
the <i>memoria technicha</i> verses of the ancient ollamhs, whose
historical and genealogical poems, which they composed in
their official capacity, are crowded with inorganic phrases
and "chevilles" of all kinds. The sixteenth-century poet
was a man of wit and learning, and frequently a better
and more clear-seeing statesman than his chief, who was in
matters of policy frequently directed by his bard's advice.
They certainly had more national feeling than any other class
in Ireland, and were less the slaves of circumstances or of mere
local accidents, for they traversed the island from end to end,
were equally welcome north, south, east, and west, and had
unrivalled opportunities for becoming acquainted with the
trend of public affairs, and with political movements.</p>

<p>Most people, owing to their comparative neglect of Irish
history, seem to be of opinion that the bards were harpers, or
at least musicians of some sort. But they were nothing of
the kind. The popular conception of the bard with the long
white beard and the big harp is grotesquely wrong. The
bards were verse-makers, pure and simple, and they were no
more musicians than the poet laureate of England. Their
business was to construct their poems after the wonderful and
complex models of the schools, and when&mdash;as only sometimes
happened&mdash;they wrote a eulogy or panegyric on a patron,
and brought it to him, they introduced along with themselves
a harper and possibly a singer to whom they had taught their
poem, and in the presence of their patron to the sound of the
harp, the only instrument allowed to be touched on such
occasions, the poem was solemnly recited or sung. The real
name of the musician was not <i>bard</i>&mdash;the bard was a verse-maker&mdash;but
<i>oirfideadh</i> [errh-fid-y&#259;], and the musicians, though
a numerous and honourable class, were absolutely distinct
from the bards and <i>filés</i>. It was only after the complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
break-up of the Gaelic polity, after the wars of Cromwell and
of William, that the verse-maker merges in the musician, and
the harper and the bard become fused in one, as was the case
with Carolan, commonly called the last of the bards, but
whom his patron, O'Conor of Belanagare, calls in his obituary
of him, not a <i>bard</i>, but an <i>oirfideadh</i>.</p>

<p>Down to the close of the sixteenth century and during the
greater part of the seventeenth, verse, with few exceptions,
continued to be made in the classical metres of Ireland, by
specially trained poets, who did not go outside these metres.
In the ensuing century the classical metres began to be discarded
and a wonderful and far-reaching change took place,
which shall be made the subject of a future chapter. We
must now proceed to examine a species of popular poetry
which flourished during all this period side by side with the
bardic schools, although no trace remains to-day of its origin
or its authors. This is the so-called Ossianic poetry.</p>

called <i>rosg</i> by the Irish. Irish literature is full of such pieces. Some of
the Brehon Law though printed in prose seems to have been composed in

"cut in two," is not really a rhyme but a generic name for a metre,
containing twenty-four species. The essence of the principal <i>Deibhidh</i>,
however, is the peculiar manner of rhyming with words of a different
length, so that this system has sometimes been loosely called <i>Deibhidh</i>
rhyme. In the oldest poetry a trisyllable instead of a dissyllable rhyme
could be used as the end word, of the second line when the first line ended
with a monosyllable, but in the strictness of later times this was disallowed.</p></div>

of bushes surrounds me, a lively blackbird sings to me his lay, I shall not
conceal it, above my many-lined book he sings to me the trill of the
birds," etc. Commenting on these verses Nigra says feelingly, "Mentre
traduco questi versi amo figurarmi il povero monaco che, or fá più di
mille anni, stava copiando il manoscritto, e distratto un istante dal canto
dei merli contemplava dalla finestra della sua cella la verde corona di
boscaglie che circondava il suo monastero nell Ulster o nel Connaught, e
dopo avere ascoltato l'agile trillo degli uccelli, recitava questi strofe, e
rapigliava poi più allegro l'interrotto lavoro."
</p>
<p>
It has often been alleged that the word rhyme is derived from the Irish
<i>rím</i>, "number," <i>rímaire</i>, "a reckoner," and <i>rimim</i>, "I count;" but in Anglo-Saxon
<i>rím</i> has the same meaning, so that unless the Anglo-Saxons borrowed
the word, as they certainly did the thing, from the Irish, this is inconclusive.
</p>
<p>
In fol. 8a of the "Liber Hymnorum" we read in the preface to the very
ancient hymn "In Trinitate spes mea," the following note: "Incertum
est hautem in quo tempore factus est, Trerithim dana doronadh ocus xi.
caiptell déac ann, ocus dalíni in cech caiptiull, ocus se sillaba déc
cechai. Is foi is rithim doreir in ómine dobit ann.," <i>i.e.</i>, "in rhyme it was
made and eleven chapters thereon and two lines in every chapter, and
sixteen syllables in each. It is on <i>i</i> the <i>rhyme</i> is because of the 'omine'
that is in it." In the preface to the hymn, "Christus in nostra insula,"
the scholiast writes, "Trerithim dana dorigned," which Whitley Stokes
translates by "in <i>rhythm</i> moreover it was made," but <i>rithim</i> evidently
means the same in both passages, namely, <i>rhyme</i> not rhythm, at least if
the first passage is rightly translated by Dr. Stokes himself. I doubt,
however, if <i>rím</i> or <i>rithim</i> ever meant "rhyme" in Irish.</p></div>

metres called <i>nath</i>, metres in which the end of each line makes a vowel

six kinds of <i>náth</i> metres, called <i>Deachna</i>. All these the first bard
practised with two honourable metres besides, called the great and little

the BO-BARD all the <i>Deibhidh</i> metres, and these two, Rannaigheacht and
Deibhidh, though thus lowly thought of in early&mdash;probably pre-Danish&mdash;days,
were destined in later times, like the cuckoo birds, to oust their
fellows and reign in the forefront for many hundred years. The Tuath-bhard
had also two other metres <i>Seaghdha</i> and <i>Treochair</i>, and the Bo-bhard
in addition to Deibhidh had long and short <i>deachubhaidh.</i>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII</a></h5>

<h4>THE OSSIANIC POEMS</h4>


<p>Side by side with the numerous prose sagas which fall under
the title of "Fenian," and which we have already examined in
Chapter XXIX., there exists an enormous mass of poems,
chiefly narrative, of a minor epic type, or else semi-dramatic
épopées, usually introduced by a dialogue between St. Patrick
and the poet Ossian. Ossian<a name="FNanchor_1_728" id="FNanchor_1_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_728" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was the son of Finn mac Cúmhail,
vulgarly "Cool," and he was fabled to have lived in Tír
na n-og [T'yeer na nogue], the country of the ever-young,
the Irish Elysium, for three hundred years, thus surviving all
his Fenian contemporaries, and living to hold colloquy with St.
Patrick. The so-called Ossianic poems are extraordinarily
numerous, and were they all collected would probably (between
those preserved in Scotch-Gaelic and in Irish) amount to some
80,000 lines. My friend, the late Father James Keegan, of St.
Louis, once estimated them at 100,000. The most of them,
in the form in which they have come down to us at the present
day, seem to have been composed in rather loose metres, chiefly
imitations of Deibhidh and Rannaigheacht mór, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
even down to our fathers' time exceedingly popular both in
Ireland and the Scotch Highlands, in which latter country
Iain Campbell, the great folk-lorist, made the huge collection
which he called Leabhar na Féinne, or the Book of the
Fenians.</p>

<p>Some of the Ossianic poems relate the exploits of the
Fenians, others describe conflicts between members of that
body and worms, wild beasts and dragons, others fights with
monsters and with strangers come from across the sea; others
detail how Finn and his companions suffered from the enchantments
of wizards and the efforts made to release them,
one enumerates the Fenians who fell at Cnoc-an-áir, another
gives the names of about three hundred of the Fenian hounds,
another gives Ossian's account of his three hundred years in the
Land of the Young and his return, many more consist largely
of semi-humorous dialogues between the saint and the old
warrior; another is called Ossian's madness; another is Ossian's
account of the battle of Gabhra, which made an end of the
Fenians, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_2_729" id="FNanchor_2_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_729" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Lochlannachs, or Norsemen, figure very largely in
these poems, and it is quite evident that most of them&mdash;at
least in the modern form in which we now have them&mdash;are
post-Norse productions. The fact that the language in which
they have for the most part come down to us is popular and
modern, does not prove much one way or the other, for these
small epics which, more than any other part of Irish literature,
were handed down from father to son and propagated orally,
have had their language unconsciously adjusted from age to
age, so as to leave them intelligible to their hearers. As a
consequence the metres have in many places also suffered, and
the old Irish system, which required a certain number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
syllables in each line, has shown signs of fusing gradually with
the new Irish system, which only requires so many accented
syllables.</p>

<p>It is, however, perfectly possible&mdash;as has been supposed by,
I think, Mr. Nutt and others&mdash;that after the terrible shock
given to the island by the Northmen, this people usurped in
our ballads the place of some older mythical race; and Professor
Rhys was, I believe, at one time of opinion that Lochlann, as
spoken of in these ballads, originally meant merely the country
of lochs and seas, and that the Lochlanners were a submarine
mythical people, like the Fomorians.</p>

<p>The spirit of banter with which St. Patrick and the Church
are treated, and in which the fun just stops short of irreverence,
is a mediæval, not a primitive, trait, more characteristic, thinks
Mr. Nutt, of the twelfth than of any succeeding century.
We may remember the inimitable felicity with which that great
English-speaking Gael, Sir Walter Scott, has caught this
Ossianic tone in the lines which Hector McIntyre repeats for
Oldbuck&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Patrick the psalm-singer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since you will not listen to one of my stories,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though you have never heard it before,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am sorry to tell you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You are little better than an ass;"</span><br />
</p>

<p>to which the saint, to the infinite contempt of the unbelieving
antiquary, is made to respond&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Upon my word, son of Fingal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While I am warbling the psalms,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The clamour of your old woman's tales</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Disturbs my devotional exercises."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Whereat the heated Ossian replies&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Dare you compare your psalms</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the tales of the bare-armed Fenians,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shall think it no great harm</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wring your bald head from your shoulders."</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, however, is a real specimen from the Irish, which will
give some idea of the style of dialogue between the pair. St.
Patrick, with exaggerated episcopal severity, having Ossian
three-quarters starved, blind, and wholly at his mercy, desires
him to speak no more of Finn or of the Fenians.</p>

<blockquote>

<h5>"OSSIAN.</h5>
<p>"Alas, O Patrick, I did think that God would not be angered thereat;
I think long, and it is a great woe to me, not to speak of the way of
Finn of the Deeds.</p>

<h5>"PATRICK.</h5>
<p>"Speak not of Finn nor of the Fenians, for the Son of God will be
angry with thee for it, he would never let thee into his court and he
would not send thee the bread of each day.</p>

<h5>"OSSIAN.</h5>
<p>"Were I to speak of Finn and of the Fenians, between us two, O
Patrick the new, but only not to speak loud, he would never hear us
mentioning him.</p>

<h5>"PATRICK.</h5>
<p>"Let nothing whatever be mentioned by thee excepting the offering
of God, or if thou talkest continually of others, thou, indeed, shalt
not go to the house of the saints.</p>

<h5>"OSSIAN.</h5>
<p>"I will, O Patrick, do His will. Of Finn or of the Fenians I will
not talk, for fear of bringing anger upon them, O Cleric, if it is God's
wont to be angry."</p></blockquote>

<p>In another poem St. Patrick denounces with all the rigour
of a new reformer.</p>

<blockquote>

<h5>"PATRICK.</h5>

<p>"Finn is in hell in bonds, 'the pleasant man who used to bestow
gold,' in penalty of his disobedience to God, he is now in the house
of pain in sorrow....</p>

<p>"Because of the amusement [he had with] the hounds and for
attending the (bardic) schools each day, and because he took no heed
of God, Finn of the Fenians is in bonds....</p>

<p>"Misery attend thee, old man, who speakest words of madness;
God is better for one hour than all the Fenians of Erin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span></p>

<h5>"OSSIAN.</h5>

<p>"O Patrick of the crooked crozier, who makest me that impertinent
answer, thy crozier would be in atoms were Oscar present.</p>

<p>"Were my son Oscar and God hand to hand on Knock-na-veen, if
I saw my son down it is then I would say that God was a strong man.</p>

<p>"How could it be that God and his clerics could be better men than
Finn, the chief King of the Fenians, the generous one who was
without blemish?</p>

<p>"All the qualities that you and your clerics say are according to the
rule of the King of the Stars, Finn's Fenians had them all, and they
must be now stoutly seated in God's heaven.</p>

<p>"Were there a place above or below better than heaven, 'tis there
Finn would go, and all the Fenians he had....</p>

<p>"Patrick, inquire of God whether he recollects when the Fenians
were alive, or hath he seen east or west, men their equal in the time
of fight.</p>

<p>"Or hath he seen in his own country, though high it be above our
heads, in conflict, in battle, or in might, a man who was equal to
Finn?</p>

<h5>"PATRICK.</h5>

<p>"(<i>Exhausted with controversy and curious for Ossian's story.</i>)</p>

<p>
"'Ossian sweet to me thy voice,<br />
Now blessings choice on the soul of Finn!<br />
But tell to us how many deer<br />
Were slain at Slieve-na-man finn.'<br />
</p>

<h5>"OSSIAN.</h5>

<p>"'We the Fenians never used to tell untruth, a lie was never attributed
to us; by truth and the strength of our hands we used to come
safe out of every danger.</p>

<p>"'There never sat cleric in church, though melodiously ye may think
they chant psalms, more true to his word than the Fenians, the men
who shrank never from fierce conflicts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"'O Patrick, where was thy God the day the two came across the
sea who carried off the queen of the King of Lochlann in ships, by
whom many fell here in conflict.</p>

<p>"'Or when Tailc mac Treoin arrived, the man who put great slaughter
on the Fenians; 'twas not by God the hero fell, but by Oscar in the
presence of all.</p>

<p>"'Many a battle victory and contest were celebrated by the Fenians
of Innisfail. I never heard that any feat was performed by the king
of saints, or that <i>he</i> reddened his hand.'</p>

art devoid of sense; understand that God dwells in heaven of the
orders, and Finn and his hosts are all in pain.'</p>

<h5>"OSSIAN.</h5>

<p>"'Great, then, would be the shame for God not to release Finn from
the shackles of pain; for if God Himself were in bonds my chief
would fight on his behalf.</p>

<p>"'Finn never suffered in his day any one to be in pain or difficulty
without redeeming him by silver or gold or by battle and fight, until
he was victorious.</p>

<p>"'It is a good claim I have against your God, me to be amongst
these clerics as I am, without food, without clothing or music, without
bestowing gold on bards,</p>

<p>"'Without battling, without hunting, without Finn, without courting
generous women, without sport, without sitting in my place as was
my due, without learning feats of agility and conflict,'" etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many of these poems contain lyrical passages of great beauty.
Here, as a specimen, is Ossian's description of the things in
which Finn used to take delight. It is a truly lyrical passage,
in the very best style, rhyme, rhythm and assonance are all
combined with a most rich vocabulary of words expressive of
sounds nearly impossible to translate into English. It might
be thus attempted in verse, though not quite in the metre of
the original. Finn's pursuits as depicted here by Ossian show
him to have been a lover of nature, and are quite in keeping
with his poem on Spring; his are the tastes of one of Matthew
Arnold's "Barbarians" glorified.</p>

<p>In entire accordance with this enthusiastic love of nature
is Ossian's delightful address to the blackbird of Derrycarn, a
piece which was a great favourite with the scribes of the last
century.<a name="FNanchor_7_734" id="FNanchor_7_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_734" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Interpenetrated with the same almost sensuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
delight at the sights and sounds of nature, are the following

from the recitation of a wandering harper or poet&mdash;some

<p>

</p>

<p>Caoilte [Cweeltya] too, the third great Fenian poet, was as
impressionable to the moods of nature as his friends Ossian
and Finn. Compare with the foregoing poems his lay on the
Isle of Arran, in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_9_736" id="FNanchor_9_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_736" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<h4>THE ISLE OF ARRAN.</h4>

<p>"Arran of the many stags, the sea inpinges upon her very
shoulders! An isle in which whole companies were fed, and with
ridges among which blue spears are reddened.</p>

<p>"Skittish deer are on her pinnacles, soft blackberries on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
waving heather; cool water there is in her rivers, and musk upon
her russet oaks.<a name="FNanchor_10_737" id="FNanchor_10_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_737" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>"Greyhounds there were in her and beagles, blackberries and
sloes of the dark blackthorn, dwellings with their backs set close
against her woods, while the deer fed scattered by her oaken thickets.</p>

<p>"A crimson crop grew on her rocks, in all her glades a faultless
grass; over her crags affording friendly refuge leaping went on, and
fawns were skipping.</p>

<p>"Smooth were her level spots, fat her wild swine, cheerful her
fields ... her nuts hung on the boughs of her forest hazels, and
there was sailing of long galleys past her.</p>

<p>"Right pleasant their condition, all, when the fair weather set in.
Under her river-banks trouts lie; the seagulls wheeling round her
grand cliff answer one the other&mdash;at every fitting time delectable is
Arran!"</p></blockquote>

<p>In another poem that Caoilte is fabled to have made after he
met and consorted with St. Patrick is a vivid description of a
freezing night as it appeared to a hunter. A great frost and
heavy snow had fallen upon the whole country, so that the
russet branches of the forest were twisted together, and men
could no longer travel. "A fitting time it is now," said
Caoilte, "for wild stags and for does to seek the topmost
points of hills and rocks; a timely season for salmons to betake
them into cavities of the banks," and he uttered a lay.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cold the winter is, the wind is risen, the high-couraged unquelled
stag is on foot, bitter cold to-night the whole mountain is, yet for all
that the ungovernable stag is belling.<a name="FNanchor_11_738" id="FNanchor_11_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_738" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>

<p>"The deer of Slievecarn of the gatherings commits not his side to
the ground; no less than he, the stag of frigid Echtgé's summit who
catches the chorus of the wolves.</p>

<p>"I, Caoilte, with Brown Diarmuid,<a name="FNanchor_12_739" id="FNanchor_12_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_739" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and with keen, light-footed
Oscar; we too in the nipping nights' waning end, would listen to the
music of the [wolf] pack.</p>

<p>"But well the red deer sleeps that with his hide to the bulging
rock lies stretched, hidden as though beneath the country's surface,
all in the latter end of chilly night.</p>

<p>"To-day I am an aged ancient, and but a scant few men I know;
once on time, though, on a cold and icebound morning I used to
vibrate a sharp javelin hardily.</p>

<p>"To Heaven's King I offer thanks, to Mary Virgin's Son as well;
often and often I imposed silence on [daunted] a whole host, whose
plight to-night is very cold [<i>i.e.</i>, who are all dead now]."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is curious that in the more modern Ossianic pieces, such
as the scribes of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
delighted in transcribing, there is little mention made of
Caoilte, and the complaints about surviving the Fenians and
being vexed by the clerics are more usually put into the
mouth of Ossian.</p>

<p>Here is one of the moans of Ossian in his old age, when
fallen on evil times, and thwarted at every turn by St. Patrick
and his monks.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long was last night in cold Elphin,<a name="FNanchor_13_740" id="FNanchor_13_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_740" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though yesterday seemed to me long and ill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet longer still was this dreary day.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And long for me is each hour new born,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stricken, forlorn, and smit with grief</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the hunting lands and the Fenian bands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the long-haired, generous, Fenian chief.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hear no music, I find no feast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I slay no beast from a bounding steed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I bestow no gold, I am poor and old,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I am sick and cold, without wine or mead.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I court no more, and I hunt no more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">These were before my strong delight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I cannot slay, and I take no prey:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Weary the day and long the night.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No heroes come in their war array,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No game I play, there is nought to win;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I swim no stream with my men of might,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Long is the night in cold Elphin.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ask, O Patrick, thy God of grace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To tell me the place he will place me in,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And save my soul from the Ill One's might,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For long is to-night in cold Elphin."</span><br />
</p>

<p>There is a considerable thread of narrative running through
these poems and connecting them in a kind of series, so that
several of them might be divided into the various books of
a Gaelic epic of the Odyssic type, containing instead of the
wanderings and final restoration of Ulysses, the adventures and
final destruction of the Fenians, except that the books would
be rather more disjointed. There is, moreover, splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
material for an ample epic in the division between the Fenians
of Munster and Connacht and the gradual estrangement of the
High-king, leading up to the fatal battle of Gabhra; but the
material for this last exists chiefly in prose texts, not in the
Ossianic lays. It is very strange and very unfortunate that
notwithstanding the literary activity of Gaelic Ireland before
and during the penal times, no Keating, or Comyn, or Curtin
ever attempted to redact the Ossianic poems and throw them
into that epic form into which they would so easily and
naturally have fitted. These pieces appear to me of even
greater value than the Red Branch sagas, as elucidating the
natural growth and genesis of an epic, for the Irish progressed
just up to the point of possessing a large quantity of stray
material, minor episodes versified by anonymous long-forgotten
folk-poets; but they never produced a mind critical enough
to reduce this mass to order, coherence, and stability, and at the
same time creative enough to itself supply the necessary lacunæ.
Were it not that so much light has by this time been thrown
upon the natural genesis of ancient national epics, one might
be inclined to lay down the theory that the Irish had evolved
a scheme of their own, peculiar to themselves, and different
altogether from the epic, a scheme in which the same
characters figure in a group of allied poems and romances,
each of which, like one of Tennyson's idylls, is perfect in
itself, and not dependent upon the rest, a system which might
be taken to be a natural result of the impatient Celtic
temperament which could not brook the restraints of an epic.</p>

<p>The Ossianic lays are almost the only narrative poems
which exist in the language, for although lyrical, elegiac, and
didactic poetry abounds, the Irish never produced, except in
the case of the Ossianic épopées, anything of importance in a
narrative and ballad form, anything, for instance, of the nature
of the glorious ballad poetry of the Scotch Lowlands.</p>

<p>The Ossianic metres, too, are the eminently epic ones of
Ireland. It was a great pity, and to my thinking a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
mistake, for Archbishop Mac Hale not to have used them in
his translation of Homer, instead of attempting it in the metre
of Pope's Iliad&mdash;one utterly unknown to native Ireland.</p>

<p>I have already observed that great producers of literature as
the Irish always were&mdash;until this century&mdash;they never developed
a drama. The nearest approach to such a thing is in these
Ossianic poems. The dialogue between St. Patrick and Ossian&mdash;of
which there is, in most of the poems, either more or less&mdash;is
quite dramatic in its form. Even the reciters of the present
day appear to feel this, and I have heard the censorious self-satisfied
tone of Patrick, and the querulous vindictive whine of
the half-starved old man, reproduced with considerable humour
by a reciter. But I think it nearly certain&mdash;though I cannot
prove it<a name="FNanchor_14_741" id="FNanchor_14_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_741" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;that in former days there was real acting and a
dialogue between two persons, one representing the saint and
the other the old pagan. It was from a less promising
beginning than this that the drama of Æschylus developed.
But nothing could develop in later Ireland. Everything,
time after time, was arrested in its growth. Again and again
the tree of Irish literature put forth fresh blossoms, and before
they could fully expand they were nipped off. The conception
of bringing the spirit of Paganism and of Christianity together
in the persons of the last great poet and warrior of the one,
and the first great saint of the other, was truly dramatic in its
conception, and the spirit and humour with which it has been
carried out in the pieces which have come down to us are a
strong presumption that under happier circumstances something
great would have developed from it. If any one is still found
to repeat Macaulay's hackneyed taunt about the Irish race
never having produced a great poem, let him ask himself if it
is likely that a country, where, for a hundred years after
Aughrim and the Boyne, teachers who for long before that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
had been in danger, were systematically knocked on the head,
or sent to a jail for teaching; where children were seen learning
their letters with chalk on their father's tombstones&mdash;other
means being denied them; where the possession of a manuscript
might lead to the owner's death or imprisonment, so that
many valuable books were buried in the ground, or hidden to
rot in walls<a name="FNanchor_15_742" id="FNanchor_15_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_742" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;whether such a country were a soil on which an
epic or anything else could flourish. How, in the face of all
this, the men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
preserved in manuscript so much of the Ossianic poetry as they
did, and even rewrote or redacted portions of it, as Michael
Comyn is said to have done to "Ossian in the Land of the
Ever-Young," is to me nothing short of amazing.</p>

<p>Of the authorship of the Ossianic poems nothing is known.
In the Book of Leinster are three short pieces ascribed to
Ossian himself, and five to Finn, and other old MSS. contain
poems ascribed to Caoilte, Ossian's companion and fellow
survivor, and to Fergus, another son of Finn; but of the great
mass of the many thousand lines which we have in seventeenth
and eighteenth century MSS. there is not much which is
placed in Ossian's mouth as first hand, the pieces as I have said
generally beginning with a dialogue, from which Ossian
proceeds to recount his tale. But this dramatic form of the
lay shows that no pretence was kept up of Ossian's being the
singer of his own exploits.<a name="FNanchor_16_743" id="FNanchor_16_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_743" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> From the paucity of the pieces
attributed to him in the oldest MSS. it is probable that the
Gaelic race only gradually singled him out as their typical
pagan poet, instead of Fergus or Caoilte or any other of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
alleged contemporaries, just as they singled out his father Finn,
as the typical pagan leader of their race; and it is likely that a
large part of our Ossianic lay and literature is post-Danish,
while the great mass of the Red Branch saga is in its birth
many centuries anterior to the Norsemen's invasion.<a name="FNanchor_17_744" id="FNanchor_17_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_744" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<i>See</i> p. 208 of my "Religious Songs of Connacht" for the original of this
poem, which I copied from a MS. in the Belfast Museum. The Dean of
Lismore in Argyle jotted this poem down in phonetic spelling nearly
four hundred years ago, but the name of Elphin, being strange to him, he
took the words to be <i>na neulla fúm</i>, "the clouds round me," <i>ni nelli fiym</i>
he spells it. Elphin is an episcopal seat in the county Roscommon, where
St. Patrick abode for a while when in Connacht. I often heard in that
county the story of Ossian meeting St. Patrick when drawing stones in
Elphin, but always thought that the people of Roscommon localised the
legend in their own county. But the discovery of the Belfast copy&mdash;and
I believe there is another one in the British Museum&mdash;shows that this
was not so, and the Dean of Lismore's book proves the antiquity of the
legend. That Ailfinn (Elphin) was the original word is proved by
rhyming to <i>linn, sinn</i> and <i>Finn</i>, which <i>Fiym</i> (= fúm) could not do.</p></div>

<h4>THE LAST OF THE CLASSIC POETS</h4>


<p>The first half of the seventeenth century saw an extraordinary
re-awakening of the Irish literary spirit. This was the more
curious because it was precisely at this period that the old
Gaelic polity with its tribal system, brehon law, hereditary
bards, and all its other supports, was being upheaved by main
force and already beginning to totter to its ruin. This was the
period when to aggravate what was already to the last degree
bitter&mdash;the struggle for the soil and racial feuds&mdash;a third disastrous
ingredient, polemics, stept in, and inflamed the minds
of the opposing parties, with the additional fanaticism of
religious hatred. Yet whether it is that their works have
been better preserved to us than those of any other century,
or whether the very nearness of the end inspired them to
double exertions, certain it is that the seventeenth century,
and especially the first half of it, produced amongst the Irish
a number of most gifted men of letters. Of these the so-called
Four Masters, Seathrun or Geoffrey Keating, Father
Francis O'Mulloy, Lughaidh [Lewy] O'Clery, and Duald
Mac Firbis were the most important of the purely Irish prose
writers, whilst Phillip O'Sullivan Beare, Father Ward, and
Father Colgan, John Lynch (Bishop of Killala), Luke Wadding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
and Peter Lombard (Archbishop of Armagh), reflected credit
upon their native country by their scholarship, and elucidated
its history chiefly through the medium of Latin, as did Ussher
and Sir James Ware, two great scholars of the same period
produced by the Pale.</p>

<p>The century opened with an outburst of unexpected vigour
on the part of the old school of Irish classical bards, over whose
head the sword was then suspended, and whose utter destruction,
though they knew it not, was now rapidly approaching.
This outburst was occasioned by Teig mac Dairé,<a name="FNanchor_1_745" id="FNanchor_1_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_745" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the ollamh
or chief poet of Donough O'Brien, fourth Earl of Thomond,
(whose star, thanks to English influence, was at that time in
the ascendant), making little of and disparaging in elaborate
verse the line of Eremon,<a name="FNanchor_2_746" id="FNanchor_2_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_746" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the reigning families of Meath,
Connacht, Leinster, and Ulster, whilst exalting the kings of
the line of Eber, of whom the O'Briens were at that time the
greatest family. The form this poem took was an attack upon
the poems of Torna Eigeas, a poet who flourished soon after
the year 400, and who was tutor to Niall of the Nine Hostages,
but whose alleged poems I have not noticed, not believing those
attributed to him to be genuine, as they contain distinct Christian
allusions, and as the language does not seem particularly
antique. The bards, however, accepted these pieces as the real
work of Torna, and Teig mac Dairé now attacks him on
account of his partiality for the Eremonian Niall one thousand
two hundred years before, and argues that he had done
wrong, and that Eber, as the elder son of Milesius,
should have had the precedency over Ir and Eremon,
the younger children, and that consequently the princes
of Munster, who were Eberians, should take precedency
of the O'Nialls, O'Conors, and other Eremonians of the
Northern provinces, and of Leinster. Teig asserts that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
was Eber or Heber, son of Milesius, from whom Ireland was
called Hiber-nia. This poem, which contained about one
hundred and fifty lines, began with the words <i>Olc do thagrais a
Thorna</i>, "Ill hast thou argued, O Torna," and was immediately
taken up and answered by Lughaidh [Lewy] O'Clery, the
ollamh of the O'Donnells, in a poem containing three hundred
and forty lines, beginning "O Teig, revile not Torna." To
this Teig replied in a piece of six hundred and eighty-eight
lines, beginning <i>Eist-se a Lughaidh rem' labhradh</i>, "Listen to
my speech, O Lewy," and was again immediately answered in
a poem of about a thousand lines by O'Clery, beginning, <i>Do
chuala ar thagrais a Thaidhg</i>, "I have heard all that thou
hast argued, O Teig." In this poem O'Clery collects such
facts as he can find in history and in ancient authors, to prove
that the Eremonians had always been considered superior to
the Eberians in past ages. This called forth another rejoinder
from his opponent of one hundred and twenty-four lines, beginning
<i>A Lughaidh labhram go séimh</i>, "Let us speak courteously,
O Lewy," which was in its turn answered by O'Clery in a poem
beginning <i>Ná broisd mise a Mhic Dhaire</i>, "Provoke me not, O
son of Dairé."</p>

<p>By this time the attention of the whole Irish literary world
had been centred upon this curious dispute, and on the attacks
and rejoinders of these leading poets representing the two great
races of Northern and Southern Ireland respectively. Soon the
hereditary poets of the other great Gaelic houses joined in, as
their own descent or inclination prompted. Fearfeasa O'Cainte,
Torlough O'Brien, and Art Og O'Keefe were the principal
supporters of Teig mac Daire and the Southern Eberians,
while Hugh O'Donnell, Robert Mac Arthur, Baoghalach ruadh
Mac Egan, Anluan Mac Egan, John O'Clery, and Mac
Dermot of Moylurg, defended Lewy and the Northern
Eremonians. For many years the conflict raged, and the verses
of both parties collected into a volume of about seven thousand
lines, is known to this day as "The Contention of the Poets."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span></p>

<p>There is something highly pathetic in this last flickering up
of the spirit of the hereditary classical bards, who conducted
this dispute in precisely the same metre, language, tone, and style,
as their forefathers of hundreds of years before would have done
it, and who chose for the subject-matter of dispute an hereditary
quarrel of twelve hundred years' standing. Just as the ancient
history of the Irish began with the distinction between the
descendants of the sons of Milesius, of which we read so much
at the beginning of this volume, soon the self-same subject does
the literary spirit of the ancient time which had lasted with
little alteration from the days of St. Patrick, flare up into light
for a brief moment at the opening of the seventeenth century, ere
it expired for ever under the sword of Cromwell and of William.</p>

<p>It is altogether probable, however, that under the appearance
of literary zeal and genealogical fury, the bards who took part
in this contest were really actuated by the less apparent motive
of rousing the ardour of their respective chiefs, their pride of
blood, and their hatred of the intruder. If this, as I strongly
suspect, were the underlying cause of the "Contention," their
expiring effort to effect the impossible by the force of poetry&mdash;the
only force at their command&mdash;is none the less pathetic,
than would have been on the very brink of universal ruin, their
quarrelling, in the face of their common enemy, upon the foolish
old genealogies of a powerless past.</p>

<p>We know a good deal, however, about this Teig, son of
Dairé, the ollamh of the O'Briens, of whose poetry, all
written in elaborate and highly-wrought classical metres, we
have still about three thousand four hundred lines. He possessed
down even to the middle of the seventeenth century a fine
estate and the castle of Dunogan with its appurtenances, which
belonged to him by right of his office, as the hereditary <i>ollamh</i>
of Thomond. He was hurled over a cliff in his old age by a
soldier of Cromwell, who is said to have yelled after him with
savage exultation as he fell, "Say your rann now, little man."<a name="FNanchor_3_747" id="FNanchor_3_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_747" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
A beautiful inauguration ode to the English-bred Donogh
O'Brien, fourth Earl of Thomond, proclaims him a bard of no
ordinary good sense and merit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Bring thy case before Him (God) every day, beseech diligently
Him from whom nothing may be concealed, concerning everything
of which thou art in care, Him from whom thou shalt receive relief.</p>

<p>"Run not according to thine own desire, O Prince of the Boru
tribute, let the cause of the people be thy anxiety, and that is not the
anxiety of an idle man.</p>

<p>"Be not thou negligent in the concerns of each: since it is thy due
to decide between the people, O smooth countenance, be easy of
access, and diligent in thine own interests.</p>

<p>"Give not thyself up to play nor wine nor feast nor the delight of
music nor the caresses of maidens; measure thou the ill-deeds of
each with their due reward, without listening to the intervention
of thy council.</p>

<p>"For love, for terror, for hatred, do not pass (be thou a not-hasty
judge) a judgment misbecoming thee, O Donough&mdash;no not for bribes
of gold and silver."<a name="FNanchor_4_748" id="FNanchor_4_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_748" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In another poem, Mac Dairé warns the O'Briens to be advised
by him, and not plunge the province into war, and to take care
how they draw down upon themselves his animosity. Here
are a few of these verses, translated into the exact equivalent
of the Deibhidh metre in which they are written. They will
give a fair idea of a poet's arrogance.</p>

<p>The men who most distinguished themselves in the extraordinary
outburst of classical poetry that characterised the early
seventeenth century were Teig Dall O'H&#301;ginn, a poet of the
county Sligo, brother to the Archbishop of Tuam, and
Eochaidh [Yohy] O'Hussey, the chief bard of the Maguire of
Fermanagh. Teig Dall O'H&#301;ginn has left behind him at least
three thousand lines, all in polished classical metres, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
O'Hussey nearly four thousand. Teig Dall was the author of
the celebrated poem addressed to Brian O'Rorke, urging him
to take up arms against Elizabeth on the principle "si vis
pacem para bellum:" it begins <i>D'fhior cogaidh comhailtear
síothchain</i> "to a man of war peace is assured," and it had the
desired effect. The verses of these bards throw a great deal of
light upon the manners customs and politics of the age.
There is a curious poem extant by this Teig Dall, in which
he gives a graphic account of a night he spent in the house of
Maolmordha Mac Sweeny, a night which the poet says he
will remember for ever.<a name="FNanchor_7_751" id="FNanchor_7_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_751" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He met on that memorable night
in that hospitable house Brian mac Angus Mac Namee, the
poet in chief to Torlogh Luineach O'Neill, Brian mac Owen
O'Donnellan, the poet of Mac William of Clanrickard, and
Conor O'H&#301;ginn, the bard of Mac William-Burke. Not only
did the chieftain himself, Mac Sweeny, pay him homage, but
he received presents&mdash;acknowledgment evidently of his
admitted genius&mdash;from the poets as well. Mac Sweeny gave
to him a dappled horse, one of the best steeds in Ireland, Brian
mac Angus gave him a wolf-dog that might be matched
against any; while from Brian mac Owen he received a book
"a full well of the true stream of knowledge,"&mdash;in which
were writ "the cattle-spoils, courtships, and sieges of the
world, an explanation of their battles and progress, it was the
flower of the King-books of Erin."<a name="FNanchor_8_752" id="FNanchor_8_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_752" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Where, he asks, are all
those chiefs gone now? Alas! "the like of the men I found
before me in that perfect rath of glistening splendour, ranged
along the coloured sides of the purple-hung mansion, no eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
ever saw before,"<a name="FNanchor_9_753" id="FNanchor_9_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_753" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but they are scattered and gone, and the
death of four of them in especial seemed a loss from which
Banba [Ireland] thought she could never recover. This great
poet, in my opinion by far the finest of his contemporaries,
came to a tragical end. Six of the O'Haras of Sligo calling
at his house, ate up his provisions, and in return he issued
against them a special satire. This satire, consisting of twelve
ranns in Deibhidh [D'yevvee] metre,<a name="FNanchor_10_754" id="FNanchor_10_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_754" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> stung them to such a
pitch that they returned and cut out the tongue that could
inflict such exquisite pain, and poor O'H&#301;ginn died of their
barbarous ill-treatment some time prior to the year 1617.
None of the bardic race had ever thought that such an end could
overtake the great poet at the hands of the Gael themselves.
It was only a short time before that, when some bard envying
him his position at Coolavin in the west, far from the inroads
of the murdering foreigner, had sung:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span></p>

<p>When it is remembered that O'Hussey composed this poem
in that most difficult and artificial of metres, the Deibhidh, of
which we have just given specimens, it will be seen how much
Mangan has gained by his free and untrammelled metre, and
what technical difficulties fettered O'Hussey's art, and lent
glory to his triumph over them.</p>

<p>Both these great poets and their contemporaries had been
reared in the bardic colleges, which continued to exist, though
with gradually diminishing prestige, until near the close of the
seventeenth century. I doubt if a single college survived into
the eighteenth, to come under the cruel law which made it
penal for a Catholic to teach a school. In the seventeenth
century, however, several famous colleges of poetry are still
found. They are frequently alluded to by the poets of that
century, both in Ireland and Scotland, and always under the
generic name of "the schools," by which they mean the bardic
institutions. Few or none of those persons who did not themselves
come of a bardic tribe were admitted into them, which
accounts for the prevalence of the same surnames among the
poets for several centuries, O'Dalys, O'H&#301;ginnses, O'Coffeys,
Macgraiths, Conmees, Wards, O'Mulconrys,<a name="FNanchor_16_760" id="FNanchor_16_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_760" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> etc. None of
the students were allowed to come from the neighbourhood of
the college, but only from far-away parts of Ireland, so as not
to be distracted by the propinquity of friends and relations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
This produced a certain unity of feeling among the bardic
race, and to a great extent broke down all class prejudice, so
much so, that the bards were almost the only people in later
Ireland who belonged to their country rather than to their
lord, or tribe, or territory. It may very well be, however, that
the bardic race was not in the long run an advantage to Ireland,
and that the elaborate system of pedigrees which they preserved,
and their eulogies upon their particular patrons tended
to keep the clan spirit alive to the detriment of the idea of
a unified nationality, and to the exclusion of new political modes
of thought.</p>

<p>However this may be, it is absolutely necessary to study the
poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries if one would
come to a right understanding of the great transformation scene
then being enacted. The feelings, aspirations, and politics of
the Irish themselves are faithfully reflected in them, and though
no Irish historian, except perhaps O'Halloran, has ever read
them, yet no historian can afford to utterly neglect them. It
has become common of late years to deny that there was any real
national struggle of Ireland against England in the seventeenth
century, and my friend Mr. Standish O'Grady, in particular, from
a perusal of the English State Papers and other documents, has
striven with eloquence and brilliancy to prove that the fight
was a social and an economic one, a conflict between the
smaller gentry and the great upper lords. But such a view of
the case is flatly contradicted, indeed absolutely disproved, by
a study of the Irish bards. The names of Erin, Banba, Fódhla,
the Plain of Conn, the Land of the Children of Ir and Eber,
are in their mouths at every moment, and to the very last they
persisted in their efforts to combine the Gael against the Gall.
Here, for instance, is a poem, one specimen out of scores, by an
unknown poet of the sixteenth century, exhorting the Irish of
all the provinces to resistance, and it would be impossible to
tell to what tribe or even to what province the poet belonged.
I translate the poem here into a modification of the Irish metre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
and one which, it seems to me, could be very well taken over
and adapted with a fairly good effect into English.<a name="FNanchor_17_761" id="FNanchor_17_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_761" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The session of the bardic schools began about Michaelmas,<a name="FNanchor_23_767" id="FNanchor_23_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_767" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and the youthful aspirants to bardic glory came trooping, about
that season, from all quarters of the four provinces to offer with
trembling hearts their gifts to the ollamh of the bardic college,
and to take possession of their new quarters. Very extraordinary
these quarters were; for the college usually consisted
of a long low group of whitewashed buildings, excessively
warmly thatched, and lying in the hollow of some secluded
valley, or shut in by a sheltering wood, far removed from noise
of human traffic and from the bustle of the great world. But
what most struck the curious beholder was the entire absence
of windows or partitions over the greater portion of the house.</p>

<p>According as each student arrived he was assigned a
windowless room to himself, with no other furniture in it
than a couple of chairs, a clothes rail, and a bed. When
all the students had arrived, a general examination of them
was held by the professors and ollamhs, and all who could
not read and write Irish well, or who appeared to have an
indifferent memory, were usually sent away. The others
were divided into classes, and the mode of procedure was as
follows: The students were called together into the great
hall or sitting-room, amply illuminated by candles and
bog-torches, and we may imagine the head ollamh, perhaps the
venerable and patriotic O'Gnive himself, addressing them
upon their chosen profession, and finally proposing some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
burning topic such as O'Neill's abrogation of the title of
O'Neill, for the higher class to compose a poem on, in
perhaps the Great or Little Rannaigheacht [Ran-ee-&#259;cht]
metre, while for the second class he sets one more commonplace,
to be done into Deibhidh [D'yevvee] or Séadna
[Shayna], or some other classic measure, and any student
who does not know all about the syllabification, quartans,
concord, correspondence, termination, and union, which go
to the various metres, is turned over to an inferior professor.</p>

<p>The students retired after their breakfasts, to their own
warm but perfectly dark compartments, to throw themselves
each upon his bed,<a name="FNanchor_24_768" id="FNanchor_24_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_768" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and there think and compose till
supper-hour, when a servant came round to all the rooms
with candles, for each to write down what he had composed.
They were then called together into the great hall,
and handed in their written compositions to the professors,
after which they chatted and amused themselves till bed-time.</p>

<p>On every Saturday and the eve of every holiday the schools
broke up, and the students dispersed themselves over the
country. They were always gladly received by the landowners
of the neighbourhood, and treated hospitably until
their return on Monday morning. The people of the
district never failed to send in, each in turn, large supplies
to the college, so that, what between this and the presents
brought by the students at the beginning of the year, the
professors are said to have been fairly rich.</p>

<p>The schools always broke up on the 25th of March, and
the holidays lasted for six months, it not being considered
judicious to spend the warm half of the year in the close
college, from which all light and air-draughts had been so
carefully excluded.</p>

<p>I can hardly believe, however, that the students of law,
history, and classics&mdash;all the educated classes could speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
Latin, which was their means of communication with the
English<a name="FNanchor_25_769" id="FNanchor_25_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_769" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>&mdash;were treated as here described, or enjoyed such
long holidays. It was probably only a special class of
candidates for bardic degrees who were thus dealt with, and
the account above given may be somewhat exaggerated; the
students probably composed in their dark compartments only
on certain days.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century we find that the three or four
hundred metres taught in the schools of the tenth century
had been practically restricted to a couple of dozen, and
these nearly all heptasyllabic. It is quite probable, as
Thurneysen asserts, that the metres of the early Roman
hymns&mdash;themselves probably largely affected by Celtic
models&mdash;exercised in their turn a reflex influence upon
Irish poetry, and especially on that of the bards, in contradistinction
to that of the <i>filés</i>. Indeed, it is pretty certain
that if the Roman metres had not before existed in Irish the
bards would have made no scruple about copying them; and
they may thus have come by these octosyllabic and heptasyllabic
lines about which they were in after times so
particular. Of the metres chiefly in vogue in the schools
of the later centuries, the most popular was the Deibhidh,
of which I have already given so many examples.<a name="FNanchor_26_770" id="FNanchor_26_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_770" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It was,
as it were, the official metre&mdash;the hexameter of the Gael.
All the seven thousand and odd lines of the "Contention of
the Bards," for instance, are written in it. Great Rannaigheacht<a name="FNanchor_27_771" id="FNanchor_27_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_771" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
[Ran-ee-&#259;cht] was another prime heptasyllabic
favourite. It ran thus&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"To Hear Handsome Women WEEP,</span><br />

</p>

<p>I may observe here that there has been on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
Irish Continental scholars an extraordinary amount of discordant
theories as to the scansion of the Irish classical metres.
None of them seem to be agreed as to how to scan them.
Zimmer insists that the word-accent and the metrical accent
in Irish are identical, which, as Kuno Meyer has shown, is
plainly not the case. He would probably scan&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Or wíld geese thát scream fróm fàr,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>while Kuno Meyer again would insist on reading&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ór wild geése that scréam from fár,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>because, as he says, all heptasyllabic lines are to be read as
trochaic, a theory which may apply very well to some lines, as
to the above, but which is almost certain to break down after a
line or two, as in the very next line of this verse which I
have taken for a model&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Théy sweet / ér are / thán Arts / snóre,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>a scansion which does extraordinary violence to the natural
pronunciation of the words. I, for my part, do not believe
that there was ever any real metrical accent, that is, any real
alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables in the classical
Irish metres.<a name="FNanchor_29_773" id="FNanchor_29_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_773" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The one thing certain about them is the fixed
number of syllables and the rhyme, but each verse was, as it
were, separately scanned, if one may use such a term, on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
own merits. Thus the verse just quoted would be read some
way thus&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To hear handsome</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Women <i>weep</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In <i>deep</i> distress,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They sweeter <i>are</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than Arts snore."</span><br />
</p>

<p>I have frequently heard preserved in ranns or proverbs, even
to this day, isolated quatrains in these classic metres pronounced
by the people,<a name="FNanchor_30_774" id="FNanchor_30_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_774" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and they never dream of pronouncing
them otherwise than according to the natural stress of the
voice upon the words themselves, as if they were talking prose,&mdash;they
never attempt to transform the seven-syllable lines into
trochees, as Kuno Meyer would, nor the eight-syllable lines
into iambics. Of this old Gaelic prosody there appears to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
distinct reminiscence in Burns. Take this verse of his for
example&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Blythe, blythe, and merry was she,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Blythe was she but and ben,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blythe by the banks of Ern,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And blythe in Glenturit glen."</span><br />
</p>

<p>This, supplying, say the syllable "and," in the second and third
lines makes a good Rannaigheacht mór quatrain, which the
poet evidently pronounced exactly as an old Irish bard would
have done.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Blythe, blythe,</span><br />

<p>Bonaventura O'Hussey was another fine classical poet of the
beginning of the seventeenth century. He was educated for a
bard, but afterwards became a Franciscan in Louvain, where
he wrote and published an Irish work on Christian Doctrine
in 1608, which was reprinted in Antwerp three years later.
The Irish, having no press of their own in Ireland (though they
had some outside it), were obliged to print and set up all their
books abroad, chiefly at Louvain, Antwerp, Rome, and Paris.
Any attempt to introduce founts of Irish type in the teeth of
the English Government would, I think, have been futile, so
that except for the works she was able to print in Irish type
abroad, and afterwards to smuggle in, Ireland during the seventeenth
century was thrown nearly a couple of hundred years
out of the world's course, by having to use manuscripts instead
of printed books. It is curious to find O'Hussey compressing
the Christian doctrine into two hundred and forty lines of the
most accurate Deibhidh metre. When leaving for his foreign
home he bade farewell to Erin in a poem of great beauty.</p>

<p>In another poem he laments sorely at leaving the poets and
the schools "to try another trade," that of a cleric, which he
says he does, not because he thinks less of poetry, or because
the glory that was once to be had from it was departing
amongst the people of Erin, but from religious motives alone.</p>

</p>

<p>The quantity of verse composed in these classic metres all
through the seventeenth century was enormous, and amounts
to at least twenty thousand lines of the known poets not to
speak of the anonymous ones. Not more than a dozen of
them have ever been published,<a name="FNanchor_34_778" id="FNanchor_34_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_778" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and yet no one can pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
to understand the inner history of Ireland at that period without
a reference to them. Their chief characteristic is an
intense compression which produces an air of weighty sententiousness.
This was necessitated by the laws of their
composition, which required at the end of every second line
a break or suspension of the sense (such as in English would
be usually expressed by a semi-colon or colon), and which
absolutely forbade any carrying over of the sense from one
stanza into another. Hence the thought of the poet had
with each fresh quatrain to be concentrated into twenty-eight
syllables (thirty syllables in Séadna metre), with a
break or pause at the end of the fourteenth (or fifteenth).
Accordingly O'Gnive calls the poets the "schoolmen of
condensed speech,"<a name="FNanchor_35_779" id="FNanchor_35_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_779" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and the Scotch bard Mac Muirich in the
Red Book of Clanranald speaks of Teig Dall O'H&#301;ginn as
putting into less than a half-rann what others would take
a whole crooked stanza to express.<a name="FNanchor_36_780" id="FNanchor_36_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_780" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The classical metres
went, in Irish, under the generic name of <i>Dán Direach</i>, or
"straight verse;" and O'Molloy, who wrote an Irish prosody
in Latin in the seventeenth century, carried away by a contemplation
of its difficulties, exclaims that it is "Omnium quæ
unquam vidi vel audivi, ausim dicere quæ sub sole reperiuntur,
difficilimum."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span></p>

<p>It was during the seventeenth century that the greatest
change in the whole poetical system of the Irish and Scotch
Gaels was accomplished, and that a new school of versification
arose with new ideals, new principles, and new methods, which
we shall briefly glance at in the following chapter.</p>

The literal meaning of this last verse, which may be profitably compared
with Mangan's translation, is, "This night it is venom to my heart
how the fiery showers are rained down, in the company of the frozen
spikes; how it is, is a horror to the mind." The next verse is also worth
giving.

"There has been thrown open, out of the bosom of the clouds, the doors

Great Séadna is the same metre as this, except that every verse ends with
a word of three syllables. In Middle Séadna the first and third lines end
in trisyllables, the second and fourth in dissyllables. Ae-fri-Slighe is like
Middle Séadna, except that instead of the first and third lines being octosyllabic,
they all have seven syllables, as&mdash;

<p>
Little Deachna is a pretty metre with five syllables to each line, as&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"God gives me three <i>things</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Them he <i>brings</i> all three</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like a <i>corn</i> in me."</span><br />
</p>
<p>
Great Deachna contained eight and six syllables, each line ending in dissyllables&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I believe this <i>wafer</i> holy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which is <i>safer</i> surely,</span><br />

The above metres are a few of the most favourite.</p></div>

suppose," he says, "that the accented syllable coincides with the natural
accent of the word, if we consider that polysyllabic words, besides having
an accented syllable, can also have a semi-accented one (neben den
Hauptton auch einen Nebenton haben können), finally, if we take it for
granted that the syllables in which rhyme or alliteration appear must also
bear the accent or up-beat of the voice (in der Hebung stehen mussen), we
then at once come to the conclusion that each half-verse contains a
specified number of accented syllables, without, however, any <i>regular</i>
interchange of up and down beats of accented and unaccented syllables."&mdash;<i>See</i>

has written a most interesting account of a collection of bardic poems,
chiefly of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, now preserved in the Royal
Library at Copenhagen. This interesting collection is chiefly dedicated
to the praises of the Maguires of Fermanagh, and is the work of a number
of accomplished poets, most of whom are unknown to O'Reilly, even by
name. The whole collection contains 5,576 lines, of which Herr Julius
Stern has printed about a thousand, thus having the honour of being the
first to render accessible a fair specimen of the work of the current poetry
of the schools in the sixteenth century. The characteristics of this poetry
he appraises, very justly as I think, in the following words, "The language
is choice and difficult, the poetry is of the traditional type, poor
in facts, but elevated, stately, learned, and <i>very artistic</i>." See for this interesting

<h4>RISE OF A NEW SCHOOL</h4>


<p>In poetry the external form, or framework, or setting of the
poetic thought&mdash;the word-building in which the thought is enshrined&mdash;has
varied vastly from age to age and from nation to
nation. There is the system of the Greeks and Romans, according
to which every syllable of every word is, as it were,
hall-marked with its own "quantity," counted, that is, (often
almost independently of the pronunciation) to be in itself
either short or long, and their verse was made by special
collocations of these short or long syllables&mdash;a form highly
artistic and beautiful.</p>

<p>Then there is the principle of the Anglo-Saxon, Icelandic,
and Teutonic peoples, which prevailed in England even down
to the time of Chaucer, in which verse is marked only by accent
and staff-rhyme, in other words is alliterative as in the "Book
of Piers Ploughman."</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the rhymed poetry of the later Middle Ages,
of which outside of Wales and Ireland there probably exists
no example in a European vernacular language older than the
ninth century. This system, apparently invented by the Celts,
assumed in Ireland a most extraordinary and artificial form of
its own, the essence of which was that they divided the consonants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
into <i>groups</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_781" id="FNanchor_1_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_781" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and any consonant belonging to a particular
group was allowed to rhyme with any other consonant belonging
to the same. Thus a word ending in <i>t</i> could rhyme with
a word ending in <i>p</i> or <i>c</i>, but with no other; a word ending in
<i>b</i> could rhyme with one ending in <i>g</i> or <i>dy</i> but with no other,
and so on. Thus "rap" would have been considered by the
Irish to make perfect rhyme with "sat" or "mac" but not
with "rag"; and "rag" to make perfect rhyme with "slab"
or "mad," but not with "cap," "sat" or "mac."</p>

<p>This classification of the consonants which was taught in the
Irish schools for very many hundred years, and which forms the
basis of the classical poetry which we spoke of in the last
chapter, is to a considerable extent&mdash;I do not quite know how
far&mdash;founded upon really sound phonological principles,<a name="FNanchor_2_782" id="FNanchor_2_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_782" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
the ear of the Irishman was so finely attuned to it that no
mistake was ever made, for while such rhymes as "Flann"
and "ram" fell agreeably on his ear, any Irish poet for a thousand
years would have shuddered to hear "Flann" rhymed
with "raff." This accurate ear for the classification of consonants
is now almost a lost sense, but even still traces of it may
be found in the barbarous English rhymes of the Irish peasantry,
as in such rude verses as this from the County Cavan&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"By loving of a maiD,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One Catherine Mac CaBe,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She's a dear maid on me."</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span></p>

<p>Or this&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I courted lovely <i>Mary</i> at the <i>age</i> of sixteeN</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slender was her <i>waist</i> and her carriage genteeL."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or this from the County Dublin&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"When you were an acorn on the tree toP</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then was I an aigle<a name="FNanchor_3_783" id="FNanchor_3_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_783" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> coCK,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now that you are a withered ould bloCK</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still am I an aigle cock."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or this from the County Cork&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sir Henry kissed behind the bush</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sir Henry kissed the QuaKer;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well and what if he did</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sure he didn't aTe her!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Upon the whole, however, that keen perception for the nuances
of sound, and that fine ear which insisted upon a liquid
rhyming only with a fellow liquid, and so on of the other
classes, may be considered as almost wholly lost.</p>

<p>We now come to the great breaking up and total disruption
of the Irish prosody as employed for a thousand years by
thousands of poets in the bardic schools and colleges. The
principles of this great change may be summed up in two
sentences; first, <i>the adoption of vowel rhyme in place of
consonantal rhyme</i>; second, <i>the adoption of a certain number
of accents in each line in place of a certain number of
syllables</i>. These were two of the most far-reaching
changes that could overtake the poetry of any country, and
they completely metamorphosed that of Ireland.</p>

<p>It was only on the destruction of the great Milesian and
Norman families in the seventeenth century, that the rules of
poetry, so long and so carefully guarded in the bardic schools,
ceased to be taught; and it was the break up of these
schools which rendered the success of the new principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
possible. A brilliant success they had. Almost in the twinkling
of an eye Irish poetry completely changed its form and
complexion, and from being, as it were, so bound up and
swathed around with rules that none who had not spent years
over its technicalities could move about in it with vigour, its
spirit suddenly burst forth in all the freedom of the elements,
and clothed itself, so to speak, in the colours of the rainbow.
Now indeed for the first time poetry became the handmaid of
the many, not the mistress of the few; and through every nook
and corner of the island the populace, neglecting all bardic
training, burst forth into the most passionate song. Now, too,
the remnant of the bards&mdash;the great houses being fallen&mdash;turned
instinctively to the general public, and threw behind
them the intricate metres of the schools, and dropped too, at a
stroke, several thousand words, which no one except the great
chiefs and those trained by the poets understood, whilst they
broke out into beautiful, and at the same time intelligible verse,
which no Gael of Ireland and Scotland who has ever heard or
learned it is likely ever to forget. This is to my mind perhaps
the sweetest creation of all Irish literature, the real glory of the
modern Irish nation, and of the Scottish Highlands, this is the
truest note of the enchanting Celtic siren, and he who has
once heard it and remains deaf to its charm can have little heart
for song or soul for music. The Gaelic poetry of the last two
centuries both in Ireland and in the Highlands is probably the
most sensuous attempt to convey music in words, ever made by
man. It is absolutely impossible to convey the lusciousness of
sound, richness of rhythm, and perfection of harmony, in another
language. Scores upon scores of new and brilliant metres made
their appearance, and the common Irish of the four provinces
deprived of almost everything else, clung all the closer to the
Muse. Of it indeed they might have said in the words of
Moore&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Through grief and through danger thy smile has cheered my way</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till hope seemed to bud from each thorn that round about me lay."</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span></p>

<p>It is impossible to convey any idea of this new outburst
of Irish melody in another language. Suffice it to say that the
principle of it was a wonderful arrangement of vowel sounds, so
placed that in every accented syllable, first one vowel and then
another fell upon the ear in all possible kinds of harmonious
modifications. Some verses are made wholly on the Á sound,
others on the Ó, Ú, É, Í sounds, but the majority on a wonderful
and fascinating intermixture of two, three, or more. The
consonants which played so very prominent a part under the old
bardic system were utterly neglected now, and vowel sounds
alone were sought for.</p>

<p>The Scottish Gaels, if I am not mistaken, led the way in
this great change, which metamorphosed the poetry of an
entire people in both islands. The bardic system, outside of
the kingdom of the Lord of the Isles, had apparently scarcely
taken the same hold upon the nobles, in Scotland as in Ireland,
and the first modern Scotch Gaelic poet to start upon the new
system seems to have been Mary, daughter of Alaster Rua MacLeod,
who was born in Harris in 1569, and who appears to
have possessed no higher social standing than that of a kind of
lady nurse in the chief's family. If the nine poems in free
vowel metres, which are attributed to her by Mackenzie in his
great collection,<a name="FNanchor_4_784" id="FNanchor_4_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_784" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> be genuine, then I should consider her as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
pioneer of the new school. Certainly no Irishman nor Irishwoman
of the sixteenth century has left anything like Mary's
metres behind them, and indeed I have not met more than one
or two of them used in Ireland during that century.<a name="FNanchor_5_785" id="FNanchor_5_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_785" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> No one,
for instance, would have dreamt of vowel-rhyming thus, as she
does over the drowning of Mac'Illachallun:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My <i>grief</i> my <i>pain</i>,</span><br />

</p>

<p>The earliest intimations of the new school in Ireland
which I have been able to come across, occur towards the very
close of the sixteenth century, one being a war ode on a
victory of the O'Byrnes,<a name="FNanchor_6_786" id="FNanchor_6_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_786" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the other being an abhran or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
song addressed by a bard unknown to me, one John
Mac Céibhfinn to O'Conor Sligo, apparently on his being
blockaded by Red Hugh in the country of the Clan Donogh
in 1599.</p>

<p>As for the classical metres of the schools they were already
completely lost by the middle of the eighteenth century, and
the last specimen which I have found composed in Connacht
is one by Father Patrick O'Curneen,<a name="FNanchor_7_787" id="FNanchor_7_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_787" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to the house of the
O'Conors, of Belanagare, in 1734, which is in perfect
Deibhidh metre.</p>

<p>In Munster I find the poet Andrew Mac Curtin some time
between the year 1718 and 1743,<a name="FNanchor_9_789" id="FNanchor_9_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_789" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> complaining to James
Mac Donnell, of Kilkee, that he had to frame "a left-handed
awkward ditty of a thing," meaning a poem of the new
school; "but I have had to do it," he says, "to fit myself in
with the evil fashion that was never practised in Erin before,
since it is a thing that I see, that greater is the respect and
honour every dry scant-educated boor, or every clumsy <i>baogaire</i>
of little learning, who has no clear view of either alliteration
or poetry,<a name="FNanchor_10_790" id="FNanchor_10_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_790" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> gets from the noblemen of the country, than the
courteous very-educated shanachy or man of song, if he
compose a well-made lay or poem." Nevertheless, he insists
that he will make a true poem, "although wealthy men of
herds, or people of riches think that I am a fool if I compose a
lay or poem in good taste, that is not my belief. Although
rich men of herds, merchants, or people who put out money to
grow, think that great is the blindness and want of sense to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
compose a <i>duan</i> or a poem, they being well satisfied if only they
can speak the Saxon dialect, and are able to have stock of
bullocks or sheep, and to put redness [<i>i.e.</i>, of cultivation] on
hills&mdash;nevertheless, it is by me understood that they are very
greatly deceived, because their herds and their heavy riches shall

to be seen for ever," etc. The poem which he composed on
that occasion was, perhaps, the last in Deibhidh metre composed
in the province of Munster.<a name="FNanchor_11_791" id="FNanchor_11_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_791" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In Scotland the Deibhidh was not forgotten until after
Sheriffmuir, in 1715. There is an admirable elegy of 220
lines in the Book of Clanranald on Allan of Clanranald, who
was there slain.<a name="FNanchor_12_792" id="FNanchor_12_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_792" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is in no way distinguishable from an
Irish poem of the same period. There are other poems in this
book in perfect classical metres, for in the kingdom of the
Lord of the Isles the bards and their schools may be said to
have almost found a last asylum. Indeed, up to this period, so
far as I can see,&mdash;whatever may have been the case with the
spoken language&mdash;the written language of the two countries
was absolutely identical, and Irish bards and harpers found a
second home in North Scotland and the Isles, where such
poems as those of Gerald, fourth Earl of Desmond, appear to
have been as popular as they were in Munster. We may,
then, place the generation that lived between Sheriffmuir and
Culloden as that which witnessed the end of the classical
metres in both countries, over all Ireland and Gaelic-speaking
Scotland, from Sutherland in the North, to the County Kerry
in the South, so that, from that day to this, vowel-rhyming
accented metres which had been making their way in both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
countries from a little before the year 1600, have reigned
without any rival.</p>

<p>Wonderful metres these were. Here is an example of one
made on the vowels é [æ] and ó, but while the arrangement in
the first half of the verse is o/é, é/o, é/o, o; the arrangement
in the second half is o é, o é, o é, é. I have translated it in
such a way as to mark the vowel rhymes, and this will show
better than anything else the plan of Irish poetry during the
last 250 years. To understand the scheme thoroughly the
vowels must not be slurred over, but be dwelt upon and
accentuated as they are in Irish.</p>

<p>Here is another verse of a different character, in which three

<p>Here is another metre from a beautiful Scotch Gaelic
poem. The Scotch Gaels, like the Irish, produced about
the same time a wonderful outburst of lyric poetry worthy
to take a place in the national literature beside the spirited

neither they nor the Irish can be said to have at all
succeeded with the ballad.</p>

<p>These beautiful and recondite measures were meant apparently
to imitate music, and many of them are wedded to
well-known airs. They did not all come into vogue at the
same time, but reached their highest pitch of perfection and
melody&mdash;melody at times exaggerated, too luscious, almost
cloying&mdash;about the middle of the eighteenth century, at
a time when the Irish, deprived by the Penal laws of all
possibility of bettering their condition or of educating themselves,
could do nothing but sing, which they did in every
county of Ireland, with all the sweetness of the dying
swan.</p>

<p>Dr. Geoffrey Keating, the historian, himself said to have
been a casual habitué of the schools of the bards, and a close
friend of many of the bardic professors, was nevertheless one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
of the first to wring himself free from the fetters of the
classical metres, and to adopt an accented instead of a syllabic
standard of verse. We must now go back and give some
account of this remarkable man, and of some of his contemporaries
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<i>I.e.</i>, "A choice hearth beyond every country, is the mouth of the ford of
the cars [Belanagare], the smooth-ditched. A fortress welcome-giving to
poet, the bestowing homestead of good generosity." The accented system
had now been in vogue for nearly a century and a half, and if O'Curneen
had wished to preserve an even rise and fall of accent in his verses (which
he does do in his first line) he might have done so. That he did not do so,
and that none of the straight-verse or classical poets attempted it, long
after they had become acquainted with the other system, seems to me a
strong proof that they did not intend it, and that they really possessed no
system of "metrical accent" at all.
</p>
<p>
It is noticeable that O'Curneen wrote this poem in the difficult bardic
dialect, so that Charles O'Conor of Belanagare, whose native language
was Irish, was obliged in his copy to gloss over twenty words of it with
more familiar ones of his own. These uncommon bardic terms were
wholly thrown aside by the new school.</p></div>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL</a></h5>

<h4>PROSE WRITERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</h4>


<p>During the first half of the seventeeth century, the Irish,
heavily handicapped as they were, and deprived of the power
of printing, nevertheless made tremendous efforts to keep
abreast of the rest of Europe in science and literature. It was
indeed an age of national scholarship which has never since
been equalled. It was this half century that produced in rapid
succession Geoffrey Keating, the Four Masters, and Duald Mac
Firbis, men of whom any age or country might be proud,
men who amid the war, rapine, and conflagration, that rolled
through the country at the heels of the English soldiers, still
strove to save from the general wreck those records of their
country which to-day make the name of Ireland honourable
for her antiquities, traditions, and history, in the eyes of the
scholars of Europe.</p>

<p>Of these men, Keating, as a prose writer, was the greatest.
He was a man of literature, a poet, professor, theologian, and
historian, in one. He brought the art of writing limpid Irish
to its highest perfection, and ever since the publication of his
history of Ireland some two hundred and fifty years ago, the
modern language may be said to have been stereotyped.</p>

<p>Born in Tipperary, not of a native Irish, but of an ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
Norman family, as he takes care to inform us, he was at an
early age sent to the Continent to be educated for the priesthood.
There in the cloisters of some foreign seminary his
young heart was early rent with accounts of robbery, plunder,
and confiscation, as chieftain after chieftain was driven from
his home and patrimony, and compelled to seek asylum and
shelter from the magnanimous Spaniard. "The same to me,"
cries, in the hexameter of the Gael, some unhappy wanderer
contemporaneous with Keating, driven to find refuge where he
could, "the same to me are mountain or ocean, Ireland or
the West of Spain, I have shut and made fast the gates of
sorrow over my heart."<a name="FNanchor_1_796" id="FNanchor_1_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_796" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And there was scarcely a noble
family in any corner of the island whose members might not
have repeated the same. At this particular period there were
few priests of note who had not received a foreign education,
and few of the great houses who had not the most intimate
relations with France and Spain: indeed in the succeeding
century these two countries, especially France, stood to the
Irish Celts in nearly the same familiar relation as England
does at present.</p>

<p>After his return from Spain, Keating, now a doctor of
divinity, was appointed to a church in Tipperary, where his
fame as a preacher soon drew crowds together. Amongst
these arrived one day&mdash;unluckily for Keating, but luckily for
Ireland&mdash;a damsel whose relations with the English Lord
President of Munster were said not to bear the strictest
investigation, and it so chanced that the preacher's subject that
day was the very one which, for good reasons, least commended
itself to the lady. All eyes were directed against her, and she,
returning aggrieved and furious, instigated Carew to at once
put the anti-Popery laws in execution against Keating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span></p>

<p>The difficulties which the learned men of Ireland had to
fight their way through, even from the first quarter of the
seventeenth century, have scarcely been sufficiently understood
or appreciated, but they are well illustrated in the case of
Keating. It is usually assumed that the Penal laws did not
begin to operate to the intellectual ruin of the Irish until the
eighteenth century. But, in truth, the paths of learning and
progress were largely barred by them after the first quarter of the
seventeenth century. Already, as early as 1615, King James
had issued a commission to inquire into the state of education
in Ireland, and the celebrated Ussher, then Chancellor of St.
Patrick's, was placed at the head of it. Ussher was far and
away the greatest scholar of the Pale in the seventeenth century,
and his efforts in the cause of Irish antiquities have received
deserved recognition from all native writers, and yet even
Ussher appears to have shut up remorselessly the native schools
wherever he found them, on the ground that the teachers
did not conform to the established religion. Here is how
he acted towards the father of the celebrated John Lynch,
the learned antiquarian and author of the "Cambrensis
Eversus,"<a name="FNanchor_2_797" id="FNanchor_2_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_797" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who was at the head of a native college in
Galway.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We found," says Ussher, "at Galway a publique schoolmaster,
named Lynch, placed there by the cittizens, who had great numbers
of schollers not only out of the province [of Connacht] but (even),
out of the 'Pale' and other partes resorting to him. Wee had
proofe during our continuance in that citty, how his schollers
proffitted under him by the verses and orations which they presented
us. Wee sent for that schoolemaster before us, and seriously
advised him to conform to the religion established; and not prevailing
with our advices, <i>we enjoyned him to forbear teaching</i>; and I,
the Chancellour, did take recognizance of him and some others of
his relatives in that citty, in the sum of 400 <i>li</i> sterling [at that time,
fully equal to £2,000] to his Majesty's use, that from thenceforth he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
should forbeare to teach any more, without the speciall license of
the Lord Deputy."<a name="FNanchor_3_798" id="FNanchor_3_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_798" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Twelve years later we find this enlightened and really great
scholar lending all his authority to a pronouncement headed:
"The judgment of divers of the Archbishops and Bishops
of Ireland concerning toleration of Religion," in which he thus
delivers himself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The religion of the Papists is superstitious and idolatrous, their
faith and doctrine erroneous and heretical; their church in respect
of both apostatical. To give them therefore a toleration is to
consent that they may freely exercise their religion and profess their
faith and doctrine, and is a grievous sin, and that in two respects:</p>

<p>"1. It is to make ourselves accessory not only to their superstitious
idolatries and heresies, and in a word to all the abominations of
Popery, but also (which is a consequent of the former) to the
perdition of the seduced people which perish in the deluge of the
Catholick apostacy.</p>

<p>"2. To grant them toleration in respect of any money to be given
or contribution to be made by them, is to set religion at sale, and
with it the souls of the people whom Christ our Saviour hath
redeemed with His most precious blood," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>This document was signed by James Ussher, of Armagh,
Primate, with eleven other bishops, and promulgated on the
23rd of April, 1627.<a name="FNanchor_4_799" id="FNanchor_4_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_799" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It may have been in consequence of the fresh fillip thus given
to a policy which had till then been largely in abeyance&mdash;for
fear of provoking physical resistance&mdash;that Carew, already
incited against Keating by his lady friend, sent out a force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
of soldiers to seize him and bring him a prisoner into Cork.
Keating, however, received information of the design, and fled
into the famous Glen of Aherlow, where he remained for some
years effectually hidden. It was at this time, that finding
himself unable to continue his priestly labours, he conceived
the ambitious design of writing a history of Ireland from the
earliest times down to the Norman Conquest. In pursuance
of this intention he is said to have travelled in disguise up and
down through the island to consult the ancient vellum books,
at that time still preserved in the families of the hereditary
brehons or in the neighbourhood of the ancient monasteries,
which are said to have been everywhere gladly shown to him
except in the province of Connacht and parts of Ulster, where
some of the old families refused to allow him to inspect their
books because he was a Norman by race and not a Gael!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I conceive," says Keating, in his preface, "that my testimony
ought the more readily to be admitted from the fact that I treat
therein more particularly of the Gaels, and if any man deem that I
give them too much credit, let him not imagine that I do so through
partiality, praising them more than is just through love of my own
kindred, for I belong, according to my own extraction, to the Old
Galls or the Anglo-Norman race. I have seen that the natives of
Ireland are maligned by every modern Englishman who speaks of
the country. For this reason, being much grieved at the unfairness
those writers have shown to Irishmen, I have felt urged to write a
history of Ireland myself."</p></blockquote>

<p>The value of Keating's history is very great to the student
of Irish antiquity, not because of any critical faculty on the
part of Keating himself, for (perhaps luckily) this was a gift
he was not endowed with, but on account of the very lack
of it. What Keating found in the old vellums of the monasteries
and the brehons, as they existed about the year 1630&mdash;they
have, many of them, perished since&mdash;he rewrote and
redacted in his own language like another Herodotus. He
invents nothing, embroiders little. What he does not find
before him, he does not relate, &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#949; &#947;&#945;&#961; &#959;&#8016;&#957; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;, as is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
formula of Herodotus. He composed his history in the south
of Ireland, at nearly the same time that the Four Masters in
the north of Ireland were collecting the materials for their
annals, and though he wrote <i>currente calamo</i>, and is in matters
of fact less accurate than they are, yet his history is an independent
compilation made from the same class of ancient
vellums, often from the very same books from which they
also derived their information, and it must ever remain a
co-ordinate authority to be consulted by historians along with
them and the other annalists.<a name="FNanchor_5_800" id="FNanchor_5_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_800" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The opening words of his history may serve as a specimen
of his style. It begins thus&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whoever sets before him the task of inquiring into and investigating
the history and antiquity of any country, ought to adopt the
mode that most clearly explains its true state, and gives the most
correct account of its inhabitants. And because I have undertaken
to write and publish a history of Ireland, I deem myself obliged to
complain of some of the wrongs and acts of injustice practised
towards its inhabitants, as well towards the Old Galls [Anglo-Normans],
who have been in possession of the country for more
than four centuries since the English invasion, as towards the Gaels
themselves, who have owned it for three thousand years. For there
is no historian who has written upon Ireland since the English
invasion, who does not strive to vilify and calumniate both Anglo-Irish
colonists and the Gaelic natives. We have proofs of this in the
accounts of the country given by Cambrensis, Spenser, Stanihurst,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
Hanmer, Camden, Barclay, Morrison, Davis, Campion, and all the
writers of the New Galls [<i>i.e.</i>, later English settlers] who have
treated of this country. So much so that when they speak of the
Irish one would imagine that these men were actuated by the
instinct of the beetle<a name="FNanchor_6_801" id="FNanchor_6_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_801" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; for it is the nature of this animal, when it
raises its head in the summer, to flutter about without stooping to
the fair flowers of the meadow or to the blossoms of the garden&mdash;not
though they be all roses and lilies&mdash;but it bustles hurriedly
around until it meets with some disgusting ordure, and it buries
itself therein. So it is with the above-named writers. They never
allude to the virtues and the good customs of the old Anglo-Irish
and Gaelic nobility who dwelt in Ireland in their time. They write
not of their piety or their valour, or of what monasteries they
founded, what lands and endowments they gave to the Church, what
immunities they granted to the ollamhs, their bounty to the ecclesiastics
and prelates of the Church, the relief they afforded to orphans
and to the poor, their munificence to men of learning, and their
hospitality to strangers, which was so great that it may be said, in
truth, that they were not at any time surpassed by any nation of
Europe in generosity and hospitality, in proportion to the abilities
they possessed. Witness the meetings of the learned which they
used to convene, a custom unheard of amongst other nations of
Europe. And yet nothing of all this can be found in the English
writers of the time, but they dwell upon the customs of the vulgar,
and upon the stories of ignorant old women, neglecting the illustrious
action of the nobility, and all that relates to the ancient Gaels
that inhabited this island before the invasion of the Anglo-Normans."</p></blockquote>

<p>Keating's history<a name="FNanchor_7_802" id="FNanchor_7_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_802" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was perhaps the most popular book ever
written in Irish, and, as it could not be printed, it was propagated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
by hundreds of manuscript copies all over the island.
He is the author of two other voluminous books of a theological
and moral nature, called the "Key to the Shield of the
Mass," and the "Three Shafts of Death." Keating was witty,
and very fond of a good story. Here is a specimen which I
translate from his latter work. Pirates were a familiar feature
in the life of Keating's day, and he tells the following amusing
tale of one engaged in this trade, probably an O'Driscoll.
Talking of the fruit of this world Keating remarks that
though it tastes sweet it ends bitterly.</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>THE STORY OF MAC RAICÍN.</h4>


<p>"I think it happens to many a one in this world as it did to the
wild and ignorant Kerne from the west of Munster who went aboard
a warship to seek spoils on the ocean. And he put ashore in
England, and at the first town that they met on land the townspeople
came to welcome them and bring them to their houses to
entertain them, for the people of the town were mostly innkeepers.
And the Kerne wondered at their inviting himself, considering that
he did not know any of them. But he himself and some of the
people who were with him went to the house of one of them, to the
inn, and the people of the house were very kind to them for a week,
so that what between the cleanliness of the abode, and the excellence
of his bed, food, and drink, the Kerne thought his position a delightful
one.</p>

<p>"However, when he and his company were taking their leave the
innkeeper called the accountant he had, saying, '<i>make reckoning</i>'
that means in Irish, 'pay your bill,' and with that the accountant
came, and he commenced to strip the people so that they were
obliged to give full payment for everything they had had in the
house while there, and they were left bare when they went away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
And, moreover, the Kerne wondered what was the cause of himself
and the others being plundered like that, for before this he had
never known food to be bought or sold.</p>

<p>"And when he came to Erin his friends began asking him to give
an account of England. He began to tell them, and said that he
never did see a land that was better off for food and drink, fire and
bedding, or more pleasant people, and I don't know a single fault
about it, says he, except that when strangers are taking leave of the
people who entertain them, there comes down on them an infernal
horrid wretch that they call Mac Rakeen<a name="FNanchor_8_803" id="FNanchor_8_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_803" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (make reckoning) who
handles strangers rudely, and strips and spoils them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Keating then draws the moral in his own way, "that land
of England is the world; the innkeepers, the world, the flesh,
and the devil; the Kerne, people in general; and Mac Rakeen
the Death."</p>

<p>During the time when Keating was in hiding he is said to
have visited Cork and to have transcribed manuscripts which
he required for the purposes of his history almost under the very
eyes of the Lord President himself, and to have visited Dublin
in the same manner. After the departure of Carew he reappeared,
and seems to have died quietly as parish priest of
Tubrid in Tipperary about the year 1650.</p>

<p>Almost every native scholar produced by Ireland during the
seventeenth century seems to have been hampered by persecution
in the same way as Keating, and loud and bitter were the complaints
of the Irish at the policy of the English Government in
cutting them off from education. Peter Lombard, the Catholic
Archbishop of Armagh, who died in 1625, and who wrote in
Latin and published&mdash;of course abroad, he would not well do it at
home&mdash;a "Commentary on the Kingdom of Ireland," assures his
countrymen and all Europe that it had been the steady plan
of the English Government to cut off education from the Irish,
and to prevent them having a university of their own, despite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
keen longing which his countrymen had for liberal studies, and
the way in which they had always hitherto distinguished themselves
in them. Even, he asserts, whilst England was still
Catholic, her policy had been the same, and when the question
of an Irish university was being debated in the English Council
it had no bitterer enemy than a celebrated Catholic bishop.
When some one afterwards remonstrated with this dignitary
for opposing a work at once so holy and so salutary as the
establishment of a Catholic university in Ireland, the answer
made him was that it was not as a Catholic bishop he opposed
it, but as an English senator.<a name="FNanchor_9_804" id="FNanchor_9_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_804" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "Well for him," remarks
Lombard grimly, "if in the council of God and his saints, when
the severe sentence of the Deity is passed upon the bishop,
the senator by a like display of nimble wit may escape it."</p>

<p>When the university, so long and so anxiously sought for,
was actually founded, "most capacious, most splendid," as
Lombard puts it, <i>at their expense</i>, in the shape of Trinity
College, Dublin, and they found themselves excluded from its
benefits, their indignation, as expressed by Lombard and others,
knew no bounds.<a name="FNanchor_10_805" id="FNanchor_10_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_805" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But their indignation was of little use,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
because they could not back it by their arms, and when they
did so, they were beaten by Cromwell, and their last state
rendered twenty times worse than their first.</p>

<p>Mac Firbis was another native Irish author of great learning
who wrote in Irish contemporaneously with Keating. He was
himself descended from Dathi, the last pagan monarch of
Ireland, and his family had been for time out of mind the
hereditary historians of North Connacht. The great Book of
Lecan was compiled by one of his ancestors. His own greatest
surviving work is his Book of Genealogies which contains
enough to fill thirteen hundred pages of O'Donovan's edition of
the "Four Masters." This he compiled during the horrors of
the Cromwellian war, simply as a labour of love, and in the
hope that at least the names and genealogies of the nation
might be saved to posterity out of what then seemed the ruin
of all things. Another book of his was a catalogue of Irish
writers.<a name="FNanchor_11_806" id="FNanchor_11_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_806" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Mac Firbis mentions that even in his own day he
had known Irish chieftains who governed their clans according
to the "words of Fithal and the Royal Precepts,"
that is, according to the books of the Brehon law. He also
compiled or wrote out the "Chronicon Scotorum," apparently
from old manuscripts preserved in his family. He compiled, too,
a glossary of the ancients laws, of which only a fragment exists,
and made copies of five other ancient glossaries and law tracts.
He says himself, in his Book of Genealogies, that he had
compiled a dictionary of the Brehon laws in which he had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
extensive explanations of them. His genealogical volume is
divided into nine books. The first treats of Partholan, the
second of the Nemedians, the third of the Firbolg, the fourth
of the Tuatha De Danann, the fifth of the Milesians, chiefly
the Eremonians, the sixth of the Irians and the Eremonian
tribes that went under the generic name of the Dal Fiatach,
the seventh of the Eberians and of the Ithians of Munster, the
eighth of the Saints of Ireland, and the ninth and last treats ot
the families descended from the Fomorians, Danes, Saxons,
and Anglo-Normans.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Here," says Mac Firbis, "is the distinction which the profound
historians draw between the three different races which are in Erin.
Every one who is white of skin, brown of hair, bold, honourable,
daring, prosperous, bountiful in the bestowal of property wealth and
rings, and who is not afraid of battle or combats, they are the
descendants of the sons of Milesius in Erin.</p>

<p>"Every one who is fair-haired, vengeful, large, and every plunderer,
every musical person, the professors of musical and entertaining
performances, who are adepts in all druidical and magical arts, they
are the descendants of the Tuatha De Danann in Erin.<a name="FNanchor_12_807" id="FNanchor_12_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_807" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>"Every one who is black-haired, who is a tattler, guileful, tale-telling,
noisy, contemptible, every wretched, mean, strolling, unsteady,
harsh, and inhospitable person, every slave, every mean thief, every
churl, every one who loves not to listen to music and entertainment,
the disturbers of every council and every assembly, and the promoters
of discord among people, these are of the descendants of the
Firbolg, of the Gailiuns,<a name="FNanchor_13_808" id="FNanchor_13_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_808" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of Liogairné, and of the Fir Domhnann in
Erin. But, however, the descendants of the Firbolg are the most
numerous of all these.</p>

<p>"This is taken from an old book. And, indeed, that it is possible to
identify a race by their personal appearance and dispositions I do
not take upon myself positively to say, for it may have been true in
the ancient times, until the race became repeatedly intermixed. For
we daily see even in our own time, and we often hear it from our old
men, that there is a similitude of people, a similitude of form, character,
and names in some families of Erin compared with others."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span></p>

<p>Mac Firbis's book, which is an enlarged continuation down
to the year 1650 or so, of the genealogical trees contained in
the Books of Leinster, Ballymote, and Lecan, is as O'Curry
remarks, perhaps the greatest national genealogical compilation
in the world, and it is sad to think that almost every tribe and
family of the many thousands mentioned in this great work
has either been utterly rooted out and exterminated, or else
been dispersed to the four winds of heaven, and the entire
genealogical system and tribal polity, kept with such care for
fifteen hundred years, has disappeared off the face of the earth
with the men who kept it.</p>

<p>Lughaidh [Lewy] O'Clery, the great northern poet, ollamh
and historian of the O'Donnells, who, in the "Contention of
the Bards" opposed Mac Dairé, lived somewhat earlier than
Keating and Mac Firbis. He has left behind him, written in the
difficult archaic Irish of the professional ollamhs, an interesting
life of Red Hugh O'Donnell, giving the history of the time
from 1586 to 1602,<a name="FNanchor_14_809" id="FNanchor_14_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_809" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> with a full account of his hero's birth, his
treacherous capture and confinement in Dublin Castle, his
escape and recapture, his second escape, and the hardships he
underwent in returning to his people in Donegal, his inauguration
as the O'Donnell, and his "crowded hour of glorious
life," until his death at Simancas in 1608, poisoned as we now
know almost to a certainty, from the publication of the State
Papers, by an emissary of Mountjoy the Lord Deputy, and
Carew the President of Munster. Of this, however, Lughaidh
O'Clery had no suspicion, he only tells of the sudden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
unexpected sickness which overtook O'Donnell and killed him
after sixteen days, to the utter ruin of the cause of Ireland.
Here is his account, which I give as a specimen of his style,
of O'Donnell's preparations before the Battle of the Curlews:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The occupation of O'Donnell's forces during the time that he
was in this monastery was exercising themselves and preparing for
the fight and for the encounter which they were called to engage in.
They were cleaning and getting ready their guns, and drying and
exposing to the sun their grain powder, and filling their pouches, and
casting their leaden bullets and heavy spherical balls, sharpening
their strong-handled spears and their war-pikes, polishing their long
broadswords and their bright-shining axes, and preparing their arms
and armour and implements of war."</p></blockquote>

<p>O'Donnell's address to his soldiers is quite differently recorded
from the way in which O'Sullivan Beare relates it; it is
much less ornate and eloquent, but is probably far more nearly
correct, for Lughaidh O'Clery may very well have heard it
delivered himself, and it had not passed with him through the
disfiguring medium of the Latin language.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We, though a small number," said O'Donnell, "are on the side of
the right as it seems to us, and the English whose number is large
are on the side of robbery, in order to rob you of your native land
and your means of living, and it is far easier for you to make a brave,
stout, strong fight for your native land and your lives whilst you are
your own masters and your weapons are in your hands, then when
you are put into prison and in chains after being despoiled of your
weapons, and when your limbs are bound with hard, tough cords of
hemp, after being broken and torn, some of you half dead, after you
are chained and taken in crowds on waggons and carts through the
streets of the English towns through contempt and mockery of you.
My blessing upon you, true men. Bear in your minds the firm resolution
that you had when such insults and violence were offered to
you (as was done to many of your race) that this day is the day of
battle which you have needed to make a vigorous fight in defence of
your liberty by the strength of your arms and by the courage of your
hearts, while you have your bodies under your own control and your
weapons in your hands. Have no dread nor fear of the great
numbers of the soldiers of London, nor of the strangeness of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
weapons and arms, but put your hope and confidence in the God of
glory. I am certain if ye take to heart what I say the foreigner must
be defeated and ye victorious."</p></blockquote>

<p>O'Clery's summing up of the effects of the fatal battle of
Kinsale, almost the only battle in which the Irish were defeated
throughout the whole war, is pathetic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Though there fell," he writes, "but so small a number of the
Irish in that battle of Kinsale, that they would not perceive their
absence after a time, and, moreover, that they did not perceive
it themselves then, yet there was not lost in one battle fought in the
latter times in Ireland so much as was lost then.</p>

<p>"There was lost there, first, that one island which was the richest
and most productive, the heat and cold of which were more temperate
than in the greater part of Europe, in which there was much
honey and corn and fish, many rivers, cataracts, and waterfalls, in
which were calm productive harbours, qualities which the first man
of the race of Gaedhal Glas, son of Niall, who came to Ireland beheld
in it.... There were lost, too, those who escaped from it of the
free, generous, noble-born descendants of the sons of Milesius and
of the prosperous, impetuous chiefs, of the lords of territories and
tribes, and of the chieftains of districts and cantreds, for it is absolutely
certain that there were never in Erin at any time together men who
were better and more famous than the chiefs who were then, and who
died afterwards in other countries one after the other, after their
being robbed of their fatherland and their noble possessions which
they left to their enemies on that battlefield. Then were lost besides,
nobility and honour, generosity and great deeds, hospitality and
goodness, courtesy and noble birth, polish and bravery, strength
and courage, valour and constancy, the authority and the sovereignty
of the Irish of Erin to the end of time."</p></blockquote>

<p>An interesting prose work, evidently written by an eye-witness,
exists of the wanderings of O'Neill and O'Donnell
upon the Continent after they had fled from Ireland in 1607.
It describes how they were driven by a storm past Sligo
harbour and past the Arran islands, where they were unable to
land for fear of the king's shipping then in Galway bay. For
thirteen days they were hurried along by a tremendous storm.
The narrator notes a curious incident which took place during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
the rough weather at open sea: two merlin falcons descended
and alit upon the ship, which were caught by the sailors who
kept and fed them; they were ultimately given by O'Neill to
the governor of a French town. After long buffeting by the
storm and after hopelessly losing their way they fell in with three
Danish ships who informed them that they were in Flemish
waters. They were afterwards nearly wrecked on the coast of
Guernsey, and finally, after twenty-one days at sea, they
managed with the utmost difficulty to put in at "Harboure de
Grace," on the French coast, just as their provisions had run
out. Their reception by the French king, the machinations of
the English ambassador against them, and their journey into
Spain<a name="FNanchor_15_810" id="FNanchor_15_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_810" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> are minutely described, evidently by some one who had
been in their own company, probably a Franciscan friar.
Their life and adventures in Spain are minutely recounted
down to the period of O'Donnell's death, who was
treacherously poisoned by an emissary from Carew, the President
of Munster, with the sanction of Mountjoy, the Lord
Deputy. It is noticeable that the Irish biographer entertained
no suspicion of this foul crime, which has, as we have

<p>Another curious piece of historical narrative by a religious
is the account given of the Irish wars from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
November, 1641, to January, 1647, by a northern friar called
O'Mellon, who was an eye-witness of much of what he
relates.<a name="FNanchor_17_812" id="FNanchor_17_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_812" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Of a somewhat similar nature is the interesting account of
Montrose's wars in the Book of Clanranald, a manuscript
written in pure Irish and in Irish characters, by a Gael from
the Islands, Niall Mac Vurich, the hereditary bard and
historian of the Clanranald.<a name="FNanchor_18_813" id="FNanchor_18_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_813" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The Mac Vurichs, who are
descended from a celebrated bard, Muireach O'Daly,<a name="FNanchor_19_814" id="FNanchor_19_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_814" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> who fled
into Scotland from O'Donnell about the year 1200, enjoyed
the farm of Stailgarry and the "four pennies of Drimsdale,
in South Uist, down to the middle of the last century, by
virtue of their hereditary office." The object of Mac Vurich
in writing the history of Montrose's campaign is to vindicate
and extol the career of Alaster Mac Donald and the Gael.
"Nothing," says the writer, "is here written except of the
people whom I have seen myself and with a part of whose
deeds I am acquainted from my own recollection." He gives
detailed accounts of several of Montrose's battles in which the
Gael, Irish and Scottish, were engaged. His account of the
fight of Auldearn is an interesting specimen of his style. He
tells us how Alaster Mac Donald, son of Coll Ciotach, son of
Gillespie,<a name="FNanchor_20_815" id="FNanchor_20_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_815" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> commanded on the right of the army that day, and
was in the act of marshalling his foot when</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"a gentleman from Lord Gordon came with a message to him
and spoke in this manner: 'Mac Donald, we have heard that there
was an agreement and a friendship between our ancestors, and that
they did not strike a blow against one another, whatever strife might
have been between the other Scots and them; neither was the fame
of any other tribe for valour greater than theirs; therefore, by way
of renewing the agreement, I would wish to receive a favour from
you, namely, an exchange of foot on the first day of my service to
my earthly king, that is, you taking my foot forces and you sending
me your own.</p>

<p>"That (arrangement) was promptly carried out by Alaster, son of
Colla. He sent four score and ten of the veteran soldiers who had
often been tested in great dangers in many places; and there came
in their stead three hundred foot of the men of the Bog of Gight,
Strathbogey, and the Braes,<a name="FNanchor_21_816" id="FNanchor_21_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_816" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> who were not accustomed to skirmishing,
hard conflict, or the loud, harsh noise of battle. Although that
was a bad exchange for Alaster it was good for his men, for they were
never in any battle or skirmish from which they came safer&mdash;it
seemed to them that the cavalry of the Gordons had no duty to
perform but to defend the foot from every danger!</p>

<p>"Alaster drew up his men in a garden which they had come to,
and he found that there remained with him of his own men but two
score and ten of his gentlemen. He put live and twenty of these
in the first rank, and five and twenty of them in the rear rank, and
drew up his three hundred foot of the Gordons in their midst and
marched before them. The men who opposed him were the
regiment of the laird of Lawers, well-trained men, and the gentlemen
of Lewis along with them. The clamour of the fight began as is
usual in every field of battle, which the foot who were behind Alaster
son of Colla, could not well endure, for some of them would not hear
the sough of an arrow or the whistling of a ball without ducking
their heads or starting aside. Alaster's defence was to go backwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
beckoning to his party with his hand to be of good courage and
march on quickly while his gentlemen were entirely engaged in
keeping their companies in order, but they failed to do it; and I
knew men who killed some of the Gordons' foot in order to prevent
them from flying. And when the enemy perceived this they prepared
to attack them and charge. Alaster ordered his men then to
gain the garden which they had forsaken before, but they were
attacked with pikes and arrows and many of them were slain on
every side of the garden before the party got into it. Alaster's sword
broke, and he got another sword into his hand, and he did not himself
remember who gave it to him, but some persons supposed it was
his brother-in-law, Mac Cáidh [Davidson] of Ardnacross, who gave
him his own sword. Davidson [himself], Feardorcha Mackay, and
other good gentlemen fell at that time at the entrance of the garden
who were waiting to have Alaster in before them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mac Vurich goes on to describe what happened to one of
Alaster's gentlemen, Ranald Mac Ceanain of Mull, who
found himself assailed by numbers of the enemy on the
outside of this garden.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He turned his face to his enemy, his sword was round his neck, his
shield on his left arm, and a hand-gun in his right hand. He pointed
the gun at them, and a party of pikemen who were after him halted.
There happened to be a narrow passage before them, and on that
account there was not one of his own party that had been after him
but went before him. There was a great slaughter made of the
Gordons' foot by the bowmen.<a name="FNanchor_22_817" id="FNanchor_22_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_817" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It happened at that moment that a
bowman was running past Ranald, and he shooting at the Gordons.
The bowman looked over his shoulder and saw the halt to which
Ranald had brought the pikemen, and he turned his hand from the
man that was before him, and aimed his arrow at Ranald, which
struck him on the cheek, and he sent a handbreadth of it through
the other cheek. Then Ranald fired the shot, but not at the bowman.
He threw the gun away and put the hand to his sword, whilst
his shield-arm was stretched far out from him in front, to defend
himself against the pikes. He made an effort to get the sword, but
it would not draw, for the belt turned round, and the sword did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
come out. He tried it the second time by laying the shield-hand
under his [other] armpit against the scabbard of the sword, and he
drew it out, but five pikes were driven into him between the breast
and chin on his thus exposing (?) himself. However, not one of the
wounds they gave him was an inch deep. He was for a while at this
work, cutting at the pikes, and at all that were stuck in the boss of
the shield. He set his back against the garden to defend himself,
and was with difficulty working his way towards the door. The
pikemen were getting daunted by all that were being cut, except one
man who was striking at him desperately and fiercely. That man
thought that he would keep his pike from being cut, and that his
opponent would fall by him. Ranald was listening all the time to
Alaster (inside the wall) rating the Gordons for the bad efforts they
were making to relieve himself from the position where he was, and
he was all the time step by step making for the door of the garden.
At last when he thought that he was near the door he gave a high
ready spring away from the pikeman, turning his back to him and
his face to the door, stooping his head. The pikeman followed him
and stooped his own head under the door, but Alaster was watching
them and he gave the pikeman a blow, so that though he turned
quickly to get back, his head struck against Ranald's thigh, from the
blow Alaster gave him, and his body falls in the doorway and his
head in the garden, and when Ranald straightened his back and
looked behind him to the door, it was thus he beheld his adversary.
The arrow that was stuck in Ranald was cut, and it was taken out of
him, and he got it drawn away, and he found the use of his tongue all
right, and power of speech&mdash;a thing he never thought to get again."</p></blockquote>

<p>This book, which is in pure Irish, was meant to be read not
only by the Highland Gaels, but by Irishmen as well, and indeed
the Black Book of Clanranald was picked up on a second-hand
bookstall in Dublin.</p>

<p>There were several other prose writers during the seventeenth
century, whose books, unlike those of Keating, Mac Firbis,
O'Clery, and others we have mentioned, had the good fortune
to be printed, but their works are mostly religious. Florence
Conry published in 1626 at Louvain a book called "the Mirror
of the Pious"<a name="FNanchor_23_818" id="FNanchor_23_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_818" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; Hugh Mac Cathmhaoil, Archbishop of Armagh,
published in 1618, also at Louvain, a book called "the Mirror
of the Sacrament of Penance"<a name="FNanchor_24_819" id="FNanchor_24_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_819" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; Theobald Stapleton published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
at Brussels in 1639, a "Book of Christian Doctrine," one
side Latin and the other Irish; Anthony Gernon published at
Louvain in 1645, a book called "The Paradise of the Soul"<a name="FNanchor_25_820" id="FNanchor_25_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_820" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>;
Richard Mac Gilla Cody printed in 1667, a book on Miracles in
Irish and English; Father Francis O'Mulloy published a long
book called "The Lamp of the Faithful"<a name="FNanchor_26_821" id="FNanchor_26_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_821" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in Irish at Louvain
in 1676, and in the following year his rare and valuable Irish
Grammar in Latin and Irish, one half of which is dedicated to
the subject of prosody, and is the fullest, most competent, and
most interesting account which we have of the Irish classical
metres as practised in the later schools, by one who was fully
acquainted both with them and their methods.</p>

<p>Several minor romantic stories, mostly fabulous creations unconnected
with Irish history, seem to have been written during
this century, and many more were translated from French,
Spanish, Latin, and possibly English.<a name="FNanchor_27_822" id="FNanchor_27_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_822" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Of the more important
works of Michael O'Clery, we shall speak in the next chapter.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_802" id="Footnote_7_802"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_802"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The first volume of Keating's History was published in Dublin by
Halliday, in 1811, but that brilliant young scholar did not live to complete
it. John O'Mahoney, the Fenian Head Centre, published a splendid
translation of the whole work from the best MSS. which in his exile he
was able to procure, in New York in 1866, but its introduction into the
United Kingdom was prohibited on the grounds that it infringed copyright.
Dr. Todd remarks on this translation, "notwithstanding the
extravagant and very mischievous political opinions avowed by Mr.
O'Mahoney, his translation of Keating is a great improvement upon the
ignorant and dishonest one published by Mr. Dermod O'Connor more
than a century ago,"&mdash;a foolish remark of Dr. Todd's, who must have
understood that most readers of Keating are to be found amongst men to
whom his own political opinions thus unnecessarily vented, were equally
"mischievous." Dr. Robert Atkinson published the Text of the "Three
Shafts of Death" without a translation, but with a most carefully-compiled
and admirable glossary in 1890. Keating's third work has never been
published, but I printed some extracts from a good MS. of it lent me by
the O'Conor Don in an American paper. My friend Mr. John Mac Neill
has pointed me out what is apparently a fourth work of Keating's on the
Blessed Virgin.</p></div>

<h4>THE IRISH ANNALS</h4>


<p>We have already at the beginning of this book had occasion
to discuss the reliability of the Irish annals,<a name="FNanchor_1_823" id="FNanchor_1_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_823" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and have seen
that from the fifth century onward they record with great
accuracy the few events for which we happen to have external
evidence, drawn either from astronomical discovery or from the
works of foreign authors. We shall here enumerate the most
important of these works, for though the documents from
which they are taken were evidently of great antiquity, yet
they themselves are only comparatively modern compilations
mostly made from the now lost sources of the ancient vellum
chronicles which the early Christian monks kept in their
religious houses, probably from the very first introduction of
Christianity and the use of Roman letters.</p>

<p>The greatest&mdash;though almost the youngest&mdash;of them all is
the much-renowned "Annals of the Four Masters." This
mighty work is chiefly due to the herculean labours of the
learned Franciscan Brother, Michael O'Clery, a native of
Donegal, born about the year 1580, who was himself descended
from a long line of scholars.<a name="FNanchor_2_824" id="FNanchor_2_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_824" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He and another scion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
Donegal, Aedh Mac an Bháird, then guardian of St. Anthony's
in Louvain, contemplated the compilation and publication of
a great collection of the lives of the Irish saints.</p>

<p>In furtherance of this idea Michael O'Clery, with the leave
and approbation of his superiors, set out from Louvain, and,
coming to Ireland, travelled through the whole length and
breadth of it, from abbey to abbey and priory to priory. Up
and down, high and low, he hunted for the ancient vellum
books and time-stained manuscripts whose safety was even then
threatened by the ever-thickening political shocks and spasms
of that most destructive age. These, whenever he found, he
copied in an accurate and beautiful handwriting, and transmitted
safely to Louvain to his friend Mac an Bháird, or
"Ward" as the name is now in English. Ward unfortunately
died before he could make use of the material thus collected by
O'Clery, but it was taken up by another great Franciscan,
Father John Colgan, who utilised the work of his friend
O'Clery by producing, in 1645, the two enormous Latin
quartos, to which we have already frequently alluded, the
first called the "Trias Thaumaturga," containing the lives
of Saints Patrick, Brigit, and Columcille; the second containing
all the lives which could be found of all the Irish
saints whose festivals fell between the first of January and the
last of March. Several of the works thus collected by O'Clery
and Colgan still happily survive.<a name="FNanchor_3_825" id="FNanchor_3_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_825" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> On the break-up of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
Convent of Louvain, they were transferred to St. Isidore's, in
Rome, and in 1872 were restored to Ireland and are now in
the Convent of the Franciscans, on Merchant's Quay, Dublin,
a restoration which prompted the fine lines of the late poet
John Francis O'Donnell.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Ireland of the four bright seas</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In troublous days these treasures came,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through clouds, through fires, through darknesses,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To Rome of immemorial name,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rome of immeasurable fame:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The reddened hands of foes would rive</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Each lovely growth of cloister&mdash;crypt&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dim folio, yellow manuscript,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where yet the glowing pigments live;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But a clear voice cried from Louvain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Give them to me for they are mine,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And so they sped across the main</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The saints their guard, the ship their shrine.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Before O'Clery ever entered the Franciscan Order he had
been by profession an historian or antiquary, and now in his
eager quest for ecclesiastical writings and the lives of saints,
his trained eye fell upon many other documents which he
could not neglect. These were the ancient books and secular
annals of the nation, and the historical poems of the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
bards. He indulged himself to the full in this unique opportunity
to become acquainted with so much valuable material,
and the results of his labours were two voluminous books, first
the "Réim Rioghraidhe," or Succession of Kings in Ireland,
which gives the name, succession, and genealogy of the kings of
Ireland from the earliest times down to the death of Malachy
the Great in 1022, and which gives at the same time the
genealogies of the early saints of Ireland down to the eighth
century, and secondly the "Leabhar Gabhála," or Book of
Invasions,<a name="FNanchor_4_826" id="FNanchor_4_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_826" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which contains an ample account of the successive
colonisations of Ireland which were made by Partholan, the
Nemedians, and the Tuatha De Danann, down to the death of
Malachy, all drawn from ancient books&mdash;for the most part now
lost&mdash;digested and put together by the friar.</p>

<p>It was probably while engaged on this work that the great
scheme of compiling the annals of Ireland occurred to him.
He found a patron and protector in Fergal O'Gara, lord of
Moy Gara and Coolavin, and with the assistance of five or
six other antiquaries, he set about his task in the secluded
convent of Donegal, at that time governed by his own
brother, on the 22nd of January, 1632, and finished it on the
10th of August, 1636, having had, during all this time, his
expenses and the expenses of his fellow-labourers defrayed by
the patriotic lord of Moy Gara.</p>

<p>It was Father Colgan, at Louvain, who first gave this great
work the title under which it is now always spoken of, that is,
"The Annals of the Four Masters." Father Colgan in the
preface to his "Acta Sanctorum Hiberniæ,"<a name="FNanchor_5_827" id="FNanchor_5_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_827" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> after recounting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
O'Clery's labours and his previous books goes on to give an
account of this last one also, and adds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As in the three works before mentioned so in this fourth one,
three [helpers of his] are eminently to be praised, namely, Farfassa
O'Mulchonry, Perigrine<a name="FNanchor_6_828" id="FNanchor_6_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_828" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> O'Clery, and Peregrine O'Duigenan, men
of consummate learning in the antiquities of the country and of
approved faith. And to these was subsequently added the co-operation
of other distinguished antiquarians, as Maurice
O'Mulconry who for one month, and Conary O'Clery who for
many months, laboured in its promotion. But since those annals
which we shall very frequently have occasion to quote in this
volume and in the others following, have been collected and
compiled by the assistance and separate study of so many
authors, neither the desire of brevity would permit us always
to quote them individually, nor would justice permit us to attribute
the labour of many to one, hence it sometimes seemed best to call
them the Annals of Donegal, for in our convent of Donegal they
were commenced and concluded. But afterwards for other reasons,
chiefly for the sake of the compilers themselves who were four most
eminent masters in antiquarian lore, we have been led to call them
the ANNALS OF THE FOUR MASTERS. Yet we said just now that
more than four assisted in their preparation; however, as their
meeting was irregular, and but two of them during a short time
laboured in the unimportant and later part of the work, while the
other four were engaged on the entire production, at least up to
the year 1267 (from which the first part and the most necessary
one for us is closed), we quote it under their name."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p>

<p>Michael O'Clery writes in his dedication to Fergal O'Gara,
after explaining the scope of the work&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I explained to you that I thought I could get the assistance of
the chroniclers for whom I had most esteem in writing a book of
annals in which these matters might be put on record, and that
should the writing of them be neglected at present they would not
again be bound to be put on record or commemorated even to
the end of the world. All the best and most copious books of annals
that I could find throughout all Ireland were collected by me&mdash;though
it was difficult for me to collect them into one place&mdash;to
write this book in your name and to your honour, for it was you
who gave the reward of their labour to the chroniclers by whom
it was written, and it was the friars of Donegal who supplied them
with food and attendance."</p></blockquote>

<p>The book is also provided with a kind of testimonium from
the Franciscan fathers of the monastery where it was written,
stating who the compilers were, and how long they had
worked under their own eyes, and what old books they had
seen with them, etc. In addition to this, Michael O'Clery
carried it to the two historians of greatest eminence in the
south of Ireland, Flann Mac Egan, of Ballymacegan, in the
Co. Tipperary, and Conor mac Brody of the Co. Clare, and
obtained their written approbation and signature, as well as
those of the Primate of Ireland and some others, and thus
provided he launched his book upon the world.</p>

<p>It has been published, at least in part, three times; first
down to the year 1171&mdash;the year of the Norman Invasion&mdash;by
the Rev. Charles O'Conor, grandson of Charles O'Conor,
of Belanagare, Carolan's patron, with a Latin translation,
and secondly in English by Owen Connellan from the year
1171 to the end. But the third publication of it&mdash;that by
O'Donovan&mdash;was the greatest work that any modern Irish
scholar ever accomplished. In it the Irish text with accurate
English translation, and an enormous quantity of notes, topographical,
genealogical, and historical, are given, and the whole
is contained in seven great quarto volumes&mdash;a work of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
any age or country might be proud. So long as Irish history
exists, the "Annals of the Four Masters" will be read in
O'Donovan's translation, and the name of O'Donovan be inseparably
connected with that of the O'Clerys.</p>

<p>As to the contents of these annals, suffice it to say that like
so many other compilations of the same kind, they begin with
<i>the Deluge</i>: they end in the year 1616. They give, from
the old books, the reigns, deaths, genealogies, etc., not only of
the high-kings but also of the provincial kings, chiefs, and
heads of distinguished families, men of science and poets, with
their respective dates, going as near to them as they can go.
They record the deaths and successions of saints, abbots,
bishops, and ecclesiastical dignitaries. They tell of the foundation
and occasionally of the overthrow of countless churches,
castles, abbeys, convents, and religious institutions. They
give meagre details of battles and political changes, and not
unfrequently quote ancient verses in proof of facts, but none
prior to the second century.<a name="FNanchor_7_829" id="FNanchor_7_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_829" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Towards the end the dry summary
of events become more garnished, and in parts elaborate
detail takes the place of meagre facts. There is no event of
Irish history from the birth of Christ to the beginning of the
seventeenth century that the first inquiry of the student will
not be, "What do the 'Four Masters' say about it?" for the
great value of the work consists in this, that we have here in
condensed form the pith and substance of the old books of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
Ireland which were then in existence but which&mdash;as the Four
Masters foresaw&mdash;have long since perished. The facts and
dates of the Four Masters are not their own facts and dates.
From confused masses of very ancient matter, they, with
labour and much sifting, drew forth their dates and synchronisms
and harmonised their facts.</p>

<p>As if to emphasise the truth that they were only redacting
the Annals of Ireland from the most ancient sources at their
command, the Masters wrote in an ancient bardic dialect
full at once of such idioms and words as were unintelligible
even to the men of their own day unless they had received a
bardic training. In fact, they were learned men writing for
the learned, and this work was one of the last efforts of the
<i>esprit de corps</i> of the school-bred shanachy which always
prompted him to keep bardic and historical learning a close
monopoly amongst his own class. Keating was Michael
O'Clery's contemporary, but he wrote&mdash;and I consider him
the first Irish historian and trained scholar who did so&mdash;for
the masses not the classes, and he had his reward in the
thousands of copies of his popular History made and read
throughout all Ireland, while the copies made of the Annals
were quite few in comparison, and after the end of the
seventeenth century little read.</p>

<p>The valuable but meagre <i>Annals of Tighearnach</i>, published by
the Rev. Charles O'Conor with a rather inaccurate Latin translation,
and now in process of publication by Dr. Whitley
Stokes, were compiled in the eleventh century. Clonmacnois
of which Tighearnach was abbot was founded in 544, and the
Annals had probably for their basis, as M. d'Arbois de
Jubainville remarks, some book in which from the very
foundation of the monastery the monks briefly noted remarkable
events from year to year. Tighearnach declares that all
Irish history prior to the founding of Emania is uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_8_830" id="FNanchor_8_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_830" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Tighearnach himself died in 1088.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span></p>

<p>Another valuable book of Annals is the <i>Chronicon Scotorum</i>,
of uncertain origin, edited for the Master of the Rolls in one
volume by the late Mr. Hennessy, from a manuscript in the
handwriting of the celebrated Duald Mac Firbis. It begins
briefly with the legended Fenius Farsa, who is said to have
composed the Gaelic language, "out of seventy-two languages."
It then jumps to the year 353 A.D., merely remarking "I pass
to another time and he who is will bless it, in this year 353
Patrick was born." At the year 432 we meet the curious
record, "a morte Concculaind [Cuchulain] herois usque ad hunc
annum 431, a morte Concupair [Conor] mic Nessa 412
anni sunt." Columcille's prayer at the battle of Cul Dremhne
is given under the year 561, and consists of three poetic ranns.
Cennfaeladh is another poet frequently quoted, and as in the
"Four Masters," we meet with numerous scraps of poems
given as authorities. On the murder of Bran Dubh, king of
Leinster, which took place in 605, two verses are quoted
curiously attributed to "an old woman of Leinster," "de quo
anus Laighen locutus rand."</p>

<p>The <i>Annals of Ulster</i> cover the period from the year 431
to 1540. Three large volumes of these have been published
for the Master of the Rolls, the first by Mr. Hennessy, the
second and third by Dr. Mac Carthy. Some verses, but not
many, are quoted as authorities in these annals also, from the
beginning of the sixth century onward.</p>

<p>The <i>Annals of Loch Cé</i> begin at 1014 and end in 1590,
though they contain a few later entries. They also are edited
for the Master of the Rolls in two volumes by Mr. Hennessy.
They contain scarcely more than half a dozen poetic quotations.</p>

<p>The <i>Annals of Boyle</i> contained in a thirteenth-century
manuscript, begin with the Creation and are continued down
to 1253. The fragmentary Annals of Boyle contain the period
from 1224 to 1562.</p>

<p>The <i>Annals of Innisfallen</i> were compiled about the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
1215, but according to O'Curry were commenced at least two
centuries before that period.</p>

<p>The <i>Annals of Clonmacnois</i> were a valuable compilation continued
down to the year 1408. The original of these annals
is lost, but an English translation of them made by one
Connla Mac Echagan, or Mageoghegan, of West Meath, for
his friend and kinsman Torlough Mac Cochlan, lord of Delvin,
in 1627, still exists, and was recently edited by the late Father
Denis Murphy, S.J.</p>

<p>These form the principal books of the annals of Ireland,
and though of completely different and independent origin
they agree marvellously with each other in matters of fact,
and contain the materials for a complete, though not an
exhaustive, history of Ireland as derived from internal sources.</p>

<p>It is very much to be regretted that no Irish writer before
Keating ever attempted, with these and the many lost books of
annals before him, to throw their contents into a regular and
continuous history. But this was never done, and the comparatively
dry chronicles remain still the sources from which
must be drawn the hard facts of the nation's past, with the
exception of those brief periods which have engaged the pens
of particular writers, such as the history of the wars of
Thomond, compiled about 1459 by Rory Mac Craith, or
the Life of Red Hugh written a century and a half later by
Lughaidh O'Clery, and the many historical sagas and "lives"
dealing with particular periods, which are really history
romanticised.</p>

852 pages of manuscript. The next was "De Sanctis in Anglia in

Battle of Ocha, which gave for five hundred years their supremacy to
the House of Niall, and then more verses under the years 489, 493,

<h4>THE BREHON LAWS</h4>


<p>Although treatises on law are not literature in the true
sense of the word, yet those of Ireland are too numerous and
valuable not to claim at least some short notice. When it
was determined by the Government, in 1852, to appoint a
Royal Commission to publish the Ancient Laws and Institutions
of Ireland, those great native scholars O'Donovan and
O'Curry (the only men who had arisen since the death of
Mac Firbis who were competent to undertake the task) set
about transcribing such volumes of the Irish law code as had
escaped the vicissitudes of time, and before they died&mdash;which
they did, unhappily, not long after they had begun this work&mdash;O'Donovan
had transcribed 2,491 pages of text, of which he
had accomplished a preliminary translation in twelve manuscript
volumes, while his fellow labourer O'Curry had transcribed
2,906 pages more, and had accomplished a tentative
translation of them which filled thirteen volumes. Four
large volumes of these laws have been already published, and
two more have been these very many years in preparation, but
have not as yet seen the light.</p>

<p>The first two of the published volumes<a name="FNanchor_1_831" id="FNanchor_1_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_831" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> contain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
Seanchus Mór [Shan&#259;&#967;us more], which includes a preface
to the text, in which we are told how and where it was put
together and purified, and the law of Athgabhail or Distress.
The second volume contains the law of hostage-sureties, of
fosterage, of Saer-stock tenure and Daer-stock tenure, and the
law of social connexions. The third volume contains the
so-called Book of Acaill, which is chiefly concerned with the
law relating to torts and injuries. It professes to be a compilation
of the dicta and opinions of King Cormac mac Art, who
lived in the third century, and of Cennfaeladh, who lived in
the seventh.<a name="FNanchor_2_832" id="FNanchor_2_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_832" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The fourth volume of the Brehon law consists
of isolated law-tracts such as that on "Taking possession,"
that containing judgments on co-tenancy, right of water,
divisions of land, and the celebrated <i>Crith Gabhlach</i> which
treats of social ranks and organisation.</p>

<p>The text itself of the Seanchus Mór, which is comprised in
the first two published volumes, is comparatively brief, but
what swells it to such a size is the great amount of commentary
in small print written upon the brief text, and the great
amount of additional annotations upon this commentary itself.
Whatever may have been the date of the original laws, the
bulk of the text is much later, for it consists of the commentaries
added by repeated generations of early Irish lawyers
piled up as it were one upon the other.</p>

<p>Most of the Brehon law tracts derive their titles not from
individuals who promulgated them, but either from the subjects
treated of or else from some particular locality connected with
the composition of the work. They are essentially digests
rather than codes, compilations, in fact, of learned lawyers.
The essential idea of modern law is entirely absent from them,
if by law is understood a command given by some one possessing
authority to do or to forbear doing, under pains and
penalties. There appears to be, in fact, no sanction laid down
in the Brehon law against those who violated its maxims, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
did the State provide any such. This was in truth the great
inherent weakness of Irish jurisprudence, and it was one
inseparable from a tribal organisation, which lacked the controlling
hand of a strong central government, and in which
the idea of the State as distinguished from the tribe had
scarcely emerged. If a litigant chose to disregard the brehon's
ruling there was no machinery of the law set in motion to
force him to accept it. The only executive authority in
ancient Ireland which lay behind the decision of the judge
was the traditional obedience and good sense of the people,
and it does not appear that, with the full force of public
opinion behind them, the brehons had any trouble in getting
their decisions accepted by the common people. Not that this
was any part of their duty. On the contrary, their business
was over so soon as they had pronounced their decision, and
given judgment between the contending parties. If one of
these parties refused to abide by this decision, it was no affair of
the brehon's, it was the concern of the public, and the public
appear to have seen to it that the brehon's decision was always
carried out. This seems to have been indeed the very essence of
democratic government with no executive authority behind it
but the will of the people, and it appears to have trained a
law-abiding and intelligent public, for the Elizabethan statesman,
Sir John Davies, confesses frankly in his admirable
essay on the true causes why Ireland was never subdued, that
"there is no nation or people under the sunne that doth love
equall and indifferent justice better than the Irish; or will rest
better satisfied with the execution thereof although it be against
themselves, so that they may have the protection and benefit
of the law, when uppon just cause they do desire it."</p>

<p>The Irish appear to have had professional advocates, a court
of appeal, and regular methods of procedure for carrying the
case before it, and if, a brehon could be shown to have
delivered a false or unjust judgment he himself was liable to
damages. The brehonship was not elective; it seems indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
in later times to have been almost hereditary, but the brehon
had to pass through a long and tedious course before he was
permitted to practise; he was obliged to be "qualified in every
department of legal science," says the text; and the Brehon
law was remarkable for its copiousness, furnishing, as Sir
Samuel Ferguson remarks, "a striking example of the length
to which moral and metaphysical refinements may be carried
under rude social conditions." As a makeweight against the
privileges which are always the concomitant of riches, the
penalties for misdeeds and omissions of all kinds were carefully
graduated in the interests of the poor, and crime or breach of
contract might reduce a man from the highest to the lowest
grade.</p>

<p>There is little intimation in the laws as to their own origin.
Like the Common Law of England, to which they bear a
certain resemblance, they appear to have been in great part
handed down from time immemorial, probably without undergoing
any substantial change. It is curious to observe how
some of the typical test-cases carry us back as far as the second
century. Thus the very first paragraph in the Law of Distress&mdash;one
of the most important institutions among the Irish,
for Distress was the procedure by which most civil claims
were made good&mdash;runs thus:<a name="FNanchor_3_833" id="FNanchor_3_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_833" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Three white cows were taken by Asal from Mogh, son of Nuada,
by an immediate seizure. And they lay down a night at Lerta on
the Boyne. They escaped from him and they left their calves, and
their white milk flowed upon the ground. He went in pursuit of
them, and seized six milch cows at the house at daybreak. Pledges
were given for them afterwards by Cairpre Gnathchoir for the
seizure, for the distress, for the acknowledgment, for triple acknowledgment,
for acknowledgment by one chief, for double acknowledgment."</p></blockquote>

<p>But these things are supposed to have happened in the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
of Conn of the Hundred Battles, yet the case remained a
leading one till the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The Brehon laws probably embody a large share of primitive
Aryan custom. Thus it is curious to meet the Indian
practice of sitting "dharna" or fasting on a debtor in full
force amongst the Irish as one of the legal forms by which
a creditor should proceed to recover his debt.<a name="FNanchor_4_834" id="FNanchor_4_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_834" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "Notice,"
says the text of the Irish law,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"precedes every distress in the case of inferior grades, except it
be by persons of distinction or upon persons of distinction; <i>fasting</i>
precedes distress in their case. He who does not give a pledge to
fasting is an evader of all. He who disregards all things shall not be
paid by God or man. He who refuses to cede what should be
accorded to fasting, the judgment upon him according to the Feini
[brehon] is that he pay double the thing for which he was fasted
upon, [but] he who fasts notwithstanding the offer of what should be
accorded to him, forfeits his legal right to anything according to
the decision of the Feini."</p></blockquote>

<p>There were, according to Irish history, four periods at which
special laws were enacted by legislative authority, first during
the reign of Cormac mac Art in the third century, secondly
when St. Patrick came, thirdly by Cormac mac Culinan the
king-bishop of Cashel, who died in 903, and lastly by Brian
Boru about a century later. But the great mass of the Brehon
Code appears to have been traditionary, or to have grown with
the slow growth of custom. None of the Brehon Law books
so far as they have as yet been given to the public, shows any
attempt to grapple with the nature of law in the abstract, or to
deal with the general fundamental principles which underlie the
conception of jurisprudence. A great number of the cases,
too, which are raised for discussion in the law-books, appear to
be rather possible than real, rather problematical cases proposed
by a teacher to his students to be argued upon according to
general principles, than as actual serious subjects for legal discussion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
This is particularly the case with a great part of the
Book of Acaill.</p>

<p>The part of the Brehon Law called the Seanchus Mór was
redacted in the year 438, according to the Four Masters, "the
age of Christ 438, the tenth year of Laeghaire, the Seanchus
and Feineachus of Ireland were purified and written." Here
is how the book itself treats of its own origin:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Seanchus of the men of Erin&mdash;what has preserved it? The
joint memory of two seniors; the tradition from one ear to another;
the composition of poets; the addition from the law of the letter;
strength from the law of nature; for these are the three rocks by
which the judgments of the world are supported."</p></blockquote>

<p>The commentary says that the Seanchus was preserved by
Ross, a doctor of the Béarla Feini or Legal dialect, by Dubhthach
[Duffach], a doctor of literature, and by Fergus, a
doctor of poetry.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whoever the poet was that connected it by a thread of poetry
before Patrick, it lived until it was exhibited to Patrick. The preserving
shrine is the poetry, and the Seanchus is what is preserved
therein."<a name="FNanchor_5_835" id="FNanchor_5_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_835" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Dubhthach exhibited to Patrick&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The judgments and all the poetry of Erin, and every law which
prevailed among the men of Erin through the law of nature and the
law of the seers, and in the judgments of the island of Erin and in
the poets.... 'The judgments of true nature,' it tells us, 'which
the Holy Ghost had spoken through the mouths of the brehons and
just poets of the men of Erin from the first occupation of this
island down to the reception of the faith, were all exhibited by
Dubhthach to Patrick. What did not clash with the Word of God
in the written law and in the New Testament and with the consensus
of the believers, was confirmed in the laws of the brehons by Patrick
and by the ecclesiastics and the chieftains of Erin; for the law of
nature had been quite right, except the faith and its obligations, and
the harmony of the church and the people&mdash;and this is the Seanchus
Mór."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span></p>

<p>M. d'Arbois de Jubainville,<a name="FNanchor_6_836" id="FNanchor_6_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_836" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> however, has shown that the
Seanchus Mór is really made up of treatises belonging to
different periods, of which that upon Immediate Seizure is the
oldest. While some of the other treatises must be of much
later date, this tract, he has proved, cannot in its present form
be later than the close of the sixth century, because it contains
no trace of the right of succession accorded to women by an
Irish council of about the year 600, while at the same time it
cannot be anterior to the introduction of Christianity, because
it contains mention of altar furniture amongst things seizable,
and contains two Latin words, <i>altoir</i> (altar) and <i>cîs</i> (cinsus =
census).<a name="FNanchor_7_837" id="FNanchor_7_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_837" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This, however, does not wholly discredit the tradition
that St. Patrick had a hand in the final redaction of at least a
part of the Seanchus Mór, for altars were certainly known in
Ireland before Patrick, and the insertion of the clause about
altar furniture may even have been due to the apostle himself.
How far certain parts of the law may have reached back into
antiquity and become stereotyped by custom before they became
stereotyped by writing there is no means of saying. But, as
M. d'Arbois de Jubainville has pointed out, the Seanchus Mór
is closely related to the Cycle of Conor and Cuchulain, as the
various allusions to King Conor, and to his arch-brehon Sencha,
and to Morann the Judge, and to Ailill, and to the custom of
the Heroes' Bit, show, while the cycle of Finn and Ossian is
passed over.</p>

<p>There are many allusions to the Seanchus Mór in Cormac's
Glossary, always referring to the glossed text, which must have
been in existence before the year 900.<a name="FNanchor_8_838" id="FNanchor_8_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_838" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Again the text of the
Seanchus Mór relies upon <i>judgments</i> delivered by ancient brehons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
such as Sencha, in the time of King Conor mac Nessa, but there
is no allusion in its <i>text</i> to books or treatises. The gloss, on the
other hand, is full of such allusions, and it is evident that in
early times the names of the Irish Law Books were legion.
Fourteen different books of civil law are alluded to by name in
the glosses on the Seanchus, and Cormac in his Glossary gives
quotations from five such books. It is remarkable that only
one of the five quoted by Cormac is among the fourteen mentioned
in the glosses on the Seanchus Mór, and this alone goes
to show the number of books upon law which were in use
amongst the ancient Irish, most of which have long since
perished.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII</a></h5>

<h4>THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h4>


<p>The Irish of the eighteenth century being almost wholly
deprived by law of all possibilities of bettering their condition,
and having the necessary means of education rigidly denied
them, turned for solace to poetry, and in it they vented their
wrongs and bitter grief. I have met nothing more painful
in literature than the constant, the almost unvarying cry of
agony sent out by every one of the Irish writers during the
latter half of the seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>There seems to have been very great literary activity
amongst the natives in almost every county of Ireland during
this period, and the poets it produced were countless; during
this period, too, the Irish appear to have translated many
religious books from French and Latin into Irish. In one way
the work of the eighteenth century is of even more value to us
than that of any earlier age, because it gives us the thoughts
and feelings of men who, being less removed from ourselves
in point of time, have probably more fully transmitted their
own nature to their descendants&mdash;the Irish of the present day.
Unhappily, however, though many volumes of the work of the
eighteenth century have survived, yet countless others have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
been lost during the last fifty years, and the only body in
Ireland competent to secure Irish manuscripts by purchase,
takes unfortunately not the slightest heed of any modern Irish
writings, which are daily perishing in numbers.</p>

<p>Of the poets of what I have called the New School,
towards the end of the seventeenth century, the most noted
was certainly David O'Bruadar, or Broder, whose extant
poems would fill a volume. They are in the most various
forms of the new metres, but their vocabulary and word-forms
are rather those of the more ancient bards, which renders his
poetry by no means easy of translation. He appears to have
been the bard <i>par excellence</i> of the Williamite wars, and bitter
is his cry of woe after the Boyne and Aughrim.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One single foot of land there is not left to us, even as alms
from the State; no, not what one may make his bed upon, but the
State will accord us the grace&mdash;strange! of letting us go safe to
Spain to seek adventures!</p>

<p>"They [the English] will be in our places, thick-hipped, mocking,
after beating us from the flower of our towns, full of pewter, brass,
plates, packages&mdash;English-speaking, shaven, cosy, tasteful.<a name="FNanchor_1_839" id="FNanchor_1_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_839" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"There will be a beaver cape on each of their hags, and a silk
gown from crown to foot; bands of churls will have our fortresses,
full of Archys (?), cheeses and pottage.</p>

<p>"These are the people&mdash;though it is painful to relate it&mdash;who are
living in our white moats, 'Goody Hook' and 'Mother Hammer,'
'Robin,' 'Saul,' and 'Father Salome'!</p>

<p>"The men of the breeches a-selling the salt,<a name="FNanchor_2_840" id="FNanchor_2_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_840" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Gammer,' 'Ruth,'
and 'Goodman Cabbage,' 'Mistress Capon,' 'Kate and Anna,'
'Russell Rank,' and 'Master Gadder'!</p>

<p>"[They are now] where Déirdre, that fair bright scion used to
roam, where Emer<a name="FNanchor_3_841" id="FNanchor_3_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_841" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the Liath Macha<a name="FNanchor_4_842" id="FNanchor_4_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_842" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> used to be, where Eevil<a name="FNanchor_5_843" id="FNanchor_5_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_843" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
used to be beside the Crag, and the elegant ladies of the Tuatha
De Danann.</p>

<p>"Where the poet-schools, the bards, and the damsels were, with
sporting, dance, wine and feasts, with pastime of kings and active
champions."</p></blockquote>

<p>For a moment, after the accession of James II. and during
the viceroyalty of Tyrconnel, courage and hope returned to
the natives. Their poetry, wherever preserved, is a veritable
mirror wherein to read their transitions of feeling.</p>

<p>But Aughrim and the Boyne put an end to the dream that
the Irish would ever again bear sway in their own land, and
the carefully-devised Penal laws proceeded to crush all remaining
independence of spirit out of them, and to grind away their
very life-blood. Once more their poets fell back into lamentations
over the past and impotent prophecies of the return of
the Stuarts and the resurrection of Erin. Despite their sentimental
affection for the paltry Stuarts, who ever used them as
their tools, many of the poets were perfectly clear-sighted about
them.</p>

<p>Every poet describes the condition of the native Irish in
almost the same strains.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Their warriors are no better off than their clergy; they are
being cut down and plundered by them [the English] every day.
See all that are without a bed except the furze of the mountains,
the bent of the curragh, and the bog-myrtle beneath their bodies.</p>

<p>"Under frost, under snow, under rain, under blasts of wind, without
a morsel to eat but watercress, green grass, sorrel of the mountain,
or clover of the hills. Och! my pity to see their nobles forsaken!</p>

<p>"Their estates were estimated for, and are now in the hands of
robbers, their towns are under the control of English-speaking
bastards, their title deeds which were firm for a while, are now in
the hands of foreigners, whose qualities are not mild.</p>

<p>"Their forts are under the sway of tradespeople; none of their
fortresses is to be seen remaining for them, but black prisons and
the houses of the fetters, and some of their heads parted from their
tender bodies.</p>

<p>"And some of them in the clutch of famine so that they die, and
some of them hunted to Connacht of the slaughter, [shut in], under
the lock of the Shannon, not easy to open, and without provision to
feed their mouths there&mdash;their warm dwellings under the control
of the perjurers."</p></blockquote>

<p>The feelings of the native Irish, smarting under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
cowardice, selfishness, and incompetence of James II., were
but moderately excited by the rather feeble attempt of his
son to regain his father's kingdom by the sword. One or
two stray bards, however, saluted his undertaking with poems:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Long in misery were we,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No man free from English gall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now our James is on the sea</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We shall see revenge for all.<a name="FNanchor_11_849" id="FNanchor_11_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_849" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flowering branch of royal blood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Soon his bud shall burst to flame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">James our friend is on the flood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Learned and good and first in fame.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Boar-hounds of the bloody fang</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We shall see them hang on high."</span><br />
</p>

<p>But this and its fellows were only spasmodic rhapsodies.
The Irish kept their real enthusiasm for the gallant attempt
of Charles Edward, and the Jacobite poems of Ireland would,
if collected, fill a large-sized volume.<a name="FNanchor_12_850" id="FNanchor_12_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_850" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> So popular did Jacobite
poetry become that it gave rise to a conventional form of its
own,<a name="FNanchor_13_851" id="FNanchor_13_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_851" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which became almost stereotyped, and which seems to
have been adopted as a test subject in bardic contests, and by
all new aspirants to the title of poet. This form introduces
the poet as wandering in a wood or by the banks of a river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
where he is astonished to perceive a beautiful lady approaching
him. He addresses her, and she answers. The charms of her
voice, mien, and bearing are portrayed by the poet. He inquires
who and whence she is, and how comes she to be thus
wandering. She replies that she is Erin, who is flying from
the insults of foreign suitors and in search of her real mate.
Upon this theme the changes are rung in every conceivable
metre and with every conceivable variation, by the poets of the
eighteenth century. Some of the best of these allegorical
pieces are distinctly poetic, but they soon degenerated into
conventionalism, so much so that I verily believe they continued
to be written even after the death of the last Stuart.
The possibility of a Jacobite rebellion gave rise to some fine war-songs
also, calling upon the Irish to break their slumbers, but
they were too exhausted and too thoroughly broken to stir,
even in the eventful '45.</p>

<p>One of the earliest writers of Jacobite poetry, and perhaps
the most voluminous man of letters of his day amongst the
native Irish, was JOHN O'NEAGHTAN of the county Meath, who
was still alive in 1715. One of his early poems was written
immediately after the battle of the Boyne, when the English
soldiery stripped him of everything he possessed in the world,
except one small Irish book. Between forty and fifty of his
pieces are enumerated by O'Reilly, and I have seen others in
a manuscript in private hands.<a name="FNanchor_14_852" id="FNanchor_14_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_852" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> These included a poem in
imitation of those called "Ossianic," of 1296 lines, and a tale
written about 1717 in imitation of the so-called Fenian tales,
an amusing allegoric story called the "Adventures of Edmund
O'Clery," and a curious but extravagant tale called the "Strong-armed
Wrestler." Hardiman had in his possession a closely-written
Irish treatise by O'Neaghtan of five hundred pages on
general geography, containing many interesting particulars
concerning Ireland, and a volume of Annals of Ireland from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
1167 to about 1700.<a name="FNanchor_15_853" id="FNanchor_15_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_853" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He also translated a great many
church hymns and, I believe, prose books from Latin. His
elegy on Mary D'Este, widow of James II., is one of the
most musical pieces I have ever seen, even in Irish&mdash;</p>

<p>TORLOUGH O'CAROLAN, born in 1670, and usually called
"the last of the bards," was one of the best known poets of the
first half of the eighteenth century. He was really a musician,
not a bard, and his advent marked the complete break-down
of the old Gaelic polity, according to which bard and harper
were different persons. Carolan was born in Meath, but
usually resided in Connacht, and having become blind from
small-pox in his twenty-second<a name="FNanchor_16_854" id="FNanchor_16_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_854" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> year he was educated as a
harper, and achieved in his day an enormous renown. He
composed over two hundred airs, many of them very lively,
and usually addressed to his patrons, chiefly to those of the old
Irish families. He composed his own words to suit his music,
and these have given him the reputation of a poet. They are
full of curious turns and twists of metre to suit his airs, to
which they are admirably wed, and very few are in regular
stanzas. They are mostly of a Pindaric nature, addressed to
patrons or to fair ladies; there are some exceptions, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
such as his celebrated ode to whiskey, one of the finest
bacchanalian songs in any language, and his much more famed
but immeasurably inferior "Receipt for Drinking." Very
many of his airs and nearly all his poetry with the exception
of about thirty pieces are lost.<a name="FNanchor_17_855" id="FNanchor_17_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_855" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He died in 1737 at Alderford,
the house of the Mac Dermot Roe.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When his death was known," says Hardiman, "it is related that
upwards of sixty clergymen of different denominations, a number of
gentlemen from the surrounding counties, and a vast concourse of
country people, assembled to pay the last mark of respect to their
favourite bard. All the houses in Ballyfarnon<a name="FNanchor_18_856" id="FNanchor_18_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_856" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> were occupied by
the former, and the people erected tents in the fields round Alderford
House. The harp was heard in every direction. The wake
lasted four days. On each side of the hall was placed a keg of
whiskey, which was replenished as often as emptied. Old Mrs. Mac
Dermot herself joined the female mourners who attended, 'to weep,'
as she expressed herself, 'over her poor gentleman, the head of all
Irish music.' On the fifth day his remains were brought forth, and
the funeral was one of the greatest that for many years had taken
place in Connacht."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another good poet was TEIG O'NAGHTEN, who lived in
Dublin, and is well known for a voluminous manuscript Irish-English
dictionary, at which he worked from 1734 to 1749.
Some twenty or thirty of his poems remain. Another
learned poet and lexicographer was HUGH MAC CURTIN of the
County Clare. With the assistance of his friend, a priest
called Conor O'Begley, he produced a great English-Irish
dictionary in Paris in 1732. He had previously published a
grammar at Louvain in small octavo in 1728. This was no
work to commend him to the powers that were, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
appears to have been cast into prison, for in a touching note
at p. 64 of the last edition of his grammar he asks the reader's
pardon for confounding an example of the imperative with
the potential mood, which he was caused to do "by the great
bother of the brawling company that is round about me in
this prison."<a name="FNanchor_19_857" id="FNanchor_19_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_857" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> What became of him eventually I do not
know.</p>

<p>Contemporaneous with him lived O'GALLAGHER, bishop of
Raphoe, who had the unique distinction of publishing a book&mdash;a
volume of Irish sermons&mdash;which went through over
twenty editions. He, also, pursued letters in the midst of
difficulties, at one time escaping from the English soldiers who
were sent out to take him by the start of only a few minutes,
the parish priest O'Hegarty of Killygarvan being captured in
his stead, and promptly shot dead by the officer in command
so soon as a rescue was attempted. His Irish is remarkable
for its simplicity and its careless use of English and foreign
words, carefully eschewed by men like Mac Curtin and
O'Neaghtan.</p>

<p>Amongst the Southerns JOHN "CLÁRACH" MAC DONNELL
was perhaps the finest poet of the first half of the eighteenth
century, but his pieces have never been collected. It was in his
house, near Charleville in the County Cork, that the poets of
the south used to meet in bardic session to exercise their
genius in public. He wrote part of a history of Ireland in
Irish and translated a portion of Homer into Irish verse, but
these are probably lost. He, too, cultivated letters under
difficulty, and had, according to Hardiman, "on more occasions
than one to save his life by hasty retreats from his
enemies the bard-hunters." Some of his poems give dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
descriptions of the state of the Irish and the savage cruelty of
their new masters. Here is how he describes one of them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Plentiful is his costly living in the high-gabled lighted-up mansion
of Brian, but tight-closed is his door, and his churlishness shut
up inside with him, in Aherlow of the fawns, in an opening between
two mountains, until famine cleaves to the people, putting them
under its sway.</p>

<p>"His gate he never opens to the moan of the unhappy wretches,
he never answers their groans nor provides food for their bodies; if
they were to take so much as a little faggot or a scollop or a crooked
rod, he would beat streams of blood out of their shoulders.</p>

<p>"The laws of the world, he used to tear them constantly to pieces,
the ravening, stubborn, shameless hound, ever putting in fast fetters
the church of God, and Oh! may heaven of the saints be a red-wilderness
for James Dawson!"<a name="FNanchor_20_858" id="FNanchor_20_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_858" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It would be impossible to enumerate here all the admirable
and melodious poets produced&mdash;chiefly by the province of
Munster&mdash;during the latter half of the eighteenth century and
the beginning of this. A few of them, however, I must notice.</p>

<p>MICHAEL COMYN, of the County Clare, was the author
of the prose story called "The Adventures of Torlogh, son of
Starn, and the Adventures of his Three Sons,"<a name="FNanchor_21_859" id="FNanchor_21_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_859" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and he revived
the Ossianic muse by his exquisite version&mdash;evidently based
upon traditional matter&mdash;of "Ossian in the Land of the
Young."<a name="FNanchor_22_860" id="FNanchor_22_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_860" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>BRIAN MAC GIOLLA MEIDHRE, or Merriman, whose poem
of the "Midnight Court," contains about a thousand lines
with four rhymes in each line, was another native of the
County Clare. This amusing and witty poem, one certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
not intended "virginibus puerisque," is a vision of Aoibhill
[Eevil], queen of the Fairies of Munster, holding a court,
where, when the poet sees it, a handsome girl is in the act
of complaining to the queen that in spite of her beauty and
fine figure and accomplishments she is in danger of dying
unwed, and asking for relief. She is opposed by an old man,
who argues against her. She answers him again, and the
court finally pronounces judgment. Standish Hayes O'Grady
once characterised this poem as being "with all its defects,
perhaps the most tasteful piece in the language,"<a name="FNanchor_23_861" id="FNanchor_23_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_861" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and it is
certainly a wonderful example of sustained rhythm and vowel-rhyme.
It was written in 1781.</p>

<p>TADHG [TEIG] GAOLACH O'SULLIVAN, of the County Cork,
was another of the most popular poets in his day. His earlier
poems contained certain indiscretions for which, in later life, he
made ample amends by devoting himself solely to religious poetry,
and attempting to turn the force of public opinion against vice in
every shape, especially drunkenness and immorality. A small
volume of his religious poems, probably the best of the kind
produced by any of the New School, was printed during his own
lifetime in Limerick, and repeatedly afterwards, at Cappoquin,
and I believe elsewhere, in Roman letters, and finally by
O'Daly, of Anglesea Street, in Dublin, 1868. His poems are
very musical and mellifluous, but abound in "Munsterisms,"
which make them difficult to readers from other provinces.
He died in 1800.</p>

<p>Another fine poet of the County Clare was DONOUGH MAC<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
CONMARA, or Macnamara, as he is usually called in English.
He was educated at Rome for the priesthood, but being of a
wild disposition he was expelled from the ecclesiastical college
there, and returning to Ireland, made his way to a famous
school in the county Waterford at Slieve Gua, in the
neighbourhood of which the people of the surrounding districts
had for over a hundred years been accustomed to support
"poor scholars" free of charge. He himself also opened a
successful school, but a young woman of the neighbourhood,
whom he had satirised, put a coal in the thatch and burnt him
out. He led a rambling existence after that. He went to
America and spent two summers and a winter in Newfoundland,
which was then largely planted by the Irish. He appears
to have also wandered a good deal about the Continent. The
longest of his poems is a kind of mock Aeneid, describing his
voyage to America and how the ship was chased by a French
cruiser. Eevil, the fairy queen of Munster, brings him away
in a dream to Elysium, where instead of Charon he finds "bald
cursing Conan" the Fenian acting as ferryman. But he is best
known by his beautiful lyric, "The Fair Hills of Holy
Ireland," which he composed apparently when on the
Continent. He led a ranting, roving, wild life, changed his
religion a couple of times with unparalleled effrontery, but
becoming blind in his old age, he repented of his sins and his
misspent life, and died some time about the beginning of this
century.<a name="FNanchor_24_862" id="FNanchor_24_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_862" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He was, like all these poets, a good scholar, as a
Latin epitaph of fourteen verses, which he wrote over the
pious Teig Gaolach proves&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Plangite Pierides, vester decessit alumnus,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Eochades<a name="FNanchor_25_863" id="FNanchor_25_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_863" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> non est, cuncta-que rura silent."</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the best known at the present day of all the Munster
poets is the witty, wicked OWEN ROE O'SULLIVAN from
Slieve Luachra, in Kerry, whose sayings and songs have been
proverbial for three generations, and whose fame has penetrated
into many counties besides his own. All the poets I have
mentioned hitherto, except perhaps the pious Teig Gaolach,
were almost professional wits, but Owen Roe, to judge from
the number of his <i>bons mots</i> that are still preserved, must have
surpassed them all. All the poets I have mentioned were also
Jacobite poets, but in elaboration of the usual Jacobite theme
of the Lady Erin, Owen Roe is easily first. His denunciations
of the foreigner were incessant. He was originally a
working man, and laboured hard with plough and spade. His
poem called the "Mower" is well known. His explanation
of a Greek passage, which puzzled his employer's son fresh
from a French college,<a name="FNanchor_26_864" id="FNanchor_26_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_864" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> first brought him into repute, and he
opened a school in the neighbourhood of Charleville as a
teacher of Latin and Greek. As was the case with very many
of the Munster bards, his passion for the frail sex was the
undoing of him. He was denounced from the altar, and his
school was given up. He died, still young, about the year
1784.</p>

<p>WILLIAM DALL O'HEFFERNAN, JOHN O'TOOMY "the
Gay," ANDREW MAC GRATH (surnamed the Mangairè Súgach,
or Merry Merchant, the frailest and wildest of all the bards),
EGAN O'RAHILLY, of Slieve Luachra in Kerry, OWEN
O'KEEFE, parish priest of Doneraile, and JOHN MURPHY, of
Rathaoineach, are a few of the names that instantly suggest
themselves to all readers of the Irish manuscripts of Munster.<a name="FNanchor_27_865" id="FNanchor_27_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_865" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The north of Ireland produced a great number of poets also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
during the eighteenth century, of whom PATRICK LINDON and
ART MAC CÚMHAIDH, both of the County Armagh, PHILLIP
BRADY, of the County Cavan, and JAMES MAC CUAIRT, of the
County Louth, a friend of Carolan's, were some of the best
known, but owing to the fatal loss of Irish manuscripts, chiefly
those of the northern half of Ireland, and the apparent determination
of the Royal Irish Academy not to use any of the
funds (granted by Government for the prosecution of Irish
studies) in the preservation of any modern texts, it is to be
feared that a great portion of their works and of those of at
least a hundred other writers of the eighteenth century is now
lost for ever.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to take a retrospect of the splendid
lyrical outburst produced by our brothers of the Scotch Highlands
contemporaneously with that of the poets I have just
mentioned, but it would extend the scope of this work too
much. There seems to me to be perhaps more substance and
more simplicity and straightforward diction in the poems of
the Scotch Gaels, and more melody and word play, purchased
at the expense of a good deal of nebulousness and unmeaning
sound, in those of the Irish Gaels; both, though they utterly
fail in the ballad, have brought the lyric to a very high pitch
of perfection.</p>

<p>In Connacht during the eighteenth century the conditions
of life were less favourable to poetry, the people were much
poorer, and there was no influential class of native schoolmasters
and scribes to perpetuate and copy Irish manuscripts,
as there was all over Munster, consequently the greater part of
the minstrelsy of that province is hopelessly lost, and even the
very names of its poets with the exception of CAROLAN,
NETTERVILLE, MAC CABE, MAC GOVERN, and a few more
of the last century, and MAC SWEENY, BARRETT, and
RAFTERY of this century, have been lost. That there existed,
however, amongst the natives of the province a most widespread
love of song and poetry, even though most of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
manuscripts have perished, is certain, for I have collected
among them, not to speak of Ossianic lays and other things,
a volume of love poems and two volumes of religious poems,<a name="FNanchor_28_866" id="FNanchor_28_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_866" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
almost wholly taken from the mouths of the peasantry. This
love of poetry and passion for song, which seems to be the
indigenous birthright of every one born in an Irish-speaking
district promises to soon be a thing of the past, thanks, perhaps
partly, to the apathy of the clergy, who in Connacht almost
always preach in English, and partly to the dislike of the gentry
to hear Irish spoken, but chiefly owing to the far-reaching and
deliberate efforts of the National Board of Education to extirpate
the national language.</p>

<p>Upon the present century I need not touch. Its early
years, during which Irish was the general language of the
nation, witnessed little or no attempts at its literary cultivation,
except amongst the people themselves, who, too poor to call
the press to their aid, kept on copying and re-copying their
beautiful manuscripts with a religious zeal, and producing
poetry&mdash;but of no very high order&mdash;over the greater part of
the country. Then came the famine, and with it collapse.
In the <i>sauve-qui-peut</i> that followed, everything went by the
board, thousands of manuscripts were lost, and the old literary
life of Ireland may be said to have come to a close amidst the
horrors of famine, fever, and emigration.</p>

<p>The advent of Eugene O'Curry and John O'Donovan,
however, gave a great impetus to the work begun by O'Reilly
and Hardiman, and men arose like Petrie and Todd to take a
<i>literary</i> interest in the nation's past, and in the language that
enshrined it. Meanwhile that language was fast dying as a
living tongue without one effort being made to save it. It is
only the last few years that have seen a real re-awakening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
interest amongst the people in their hereditary language, and the
establishment of a monthly and a weekly paper, chiefly written
in Irish.<a name="FNanchor_29_867" id="FNanchor_29_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_867" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The question whether the national language is to
become wholly extinct like the Cornish, is one which must be
decided within the next ten years. There are probably a
hundred and fifty thousand households in Ireland at this
moment where the parents speak Irish amongst themselves,
and the children answer them in English. If a current of
popular feeling can be aroused amongst these, the great cause&mdash;for
great it appears even now to foreigners, and greater it
will appear to the future generations of the Irish themselves&mdash;of
the preservation of the oldest and most cultured vernacular
in Europe, except Greek alone, is assured of success, and Irish
literature, the production of which&mdash;though long dribbling in
a narrow channel&mdash;has never actually ceased, may again, as it
is even now promising to do, burst forth into life and vigour,
and once more give that expression which in English seems
impossible, to the best thoughts and aspirations of the Gaelic
race.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV</a></h5>

<h4>THE HISTORY OF IRISH AS A SPOKEN LANGUAGE</h4>


<p>We must now follow the fortunes of the Irish language as a
spoken tongue, "questo linguaggio difficile e davvero stupendo,"
as Ascoli calls it,<a name="FNanchor_1_868" id="FNanchor_1_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_868" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which after imposing itself upon both
Dane and Norman, was brought face to face as early as
the fourteenth century with its great competitor English,
before which, despite its early victory in the contest, it has at
last nearly but not quite gone down, after an unremitting
struggle of nearly five centuries.</p>

<p>As early as the year 1360, the English appear to have taken
the alarm at the inroads which the Irish language&mdash;at that
time a much more highly-cultured form of speech than their
own&mdash;had made upon the colonists, and we find King Edward
issuing orders to the Sheriff of the Cross and Seneschal of the
Liberty of Kilkenny in these terms<a name="FNanchor_2_869" id="FNanchor_2_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_869" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As many of the English nation in the Marches and elsewhere
have again become like Irishmen, and refuse to obey our laws and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
customs, and hold parliaments after the Irish fashion, and learn to
speak the Irish tongue, and send their children among the Irish to
be nursed and taught the Irish tongue, so that the people of English
race have for the greater part become Irish; now we order (1) that
no Englishman of any state or condition shall ... [under forfeiture of
life, limbs, and everything else] follow these Irish customs, laws, and
parliaments; (2) that any one of English race shall forfeit English
liberty, if after the next feast of St. John the Baptist he shall speak
Irish with other Englishmen and meantime <i>every Englishman must
learn English</i> and must not have his children at nurse amongst the
Irish."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1367, the last year of the administration of the Duke of
Clarence, third son of Edward III, a parliament held at
Kilkenny passed the famous act that inter-marriage with the
Irish should be punished as high treason, and that any man of
English race using the Irish language should forfeit all his land
and tenements to the Crown, and forbidding also the entertainment
of bards, ministrels, and rhymers.</p>

<p>These first attacks upon the language cannot possibly have
produced much effect, for we find the English power within
a hundred years after their passing, reduced to the lowest point,
and there was scarcely an English or Norman noble in Ireland
who had not adopted an Irish name, Irish speech, and Irish
manners. The De Bourgo had became Mac William, and
minor branches of the same stem had become Mac Philpins,
Mac Gibbons, and Mac Raymonds; the Birminghams had
became Mac Feóiris, the Stauntons Mac Aveeleys, the Nangles
Mac Costellos, the Prendergasts Mac Maurices, the De
Courcys Mac Patricks, the Bissetts of Antrim Mac Keons, etc.</p>

<p>A hundred years after the Statute of Kilkenny, the English,
driven back into the Pale, which then consisted of less than
four counties, passed a law in 1465, enjoining all men of Irish
names within the Pale to take an English name, "of one
towne as Sutton, Chester, Trym, Skryne, Corke, Kinsale; or
colour as White, Black, Brown; or art or science as Cooke,
Butler," and he and his issue were ordered to use these names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
or forfeit all their goods. This, however, the parliament was
unable to carry through, none of the great Irish names within
or alongside the Pale, Mac Murroughs, O'Tooles, O'Byrnes,
O'Mores, O'Ryans, O'Conor Falys, O'Kellys, etc., seem to
have been in the least influenced by it.</p>

<p>Next an attempt was made to maintain English in at least
the seaports and borough towns, for we find an enactment of
the year 1492-93 amongst the Archives of the Urbs Intacta,
commanding that in Waterford, "no manner of man, freeman
or foreign, of the city or suburb's dwellers, shall emplead nor
defend in Irish tongue against any man in the court, but all
they that any matters shall have in court to be administered,
shall have a man that can speak English to declare his matter,
except one party be of the country [<i>i.e.</i>, of Irish race] then
every such dweller shall be at liberty to speak Irish."<a name="FNanchor_3_870" id="FNanchor_3_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_870" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Galway
followed suit in 1520, and enacted that "no Irish judge or
lawyer shall plead in no man's cause nor matter within this our
court, for it agreeth not with the king's laws."<a name="FNanchor_4_871" id="FNanchor_4_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_871" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>How far these petty attempts were successful may be judged
from the fact that Captain Ap Harry, a Welsh officer, describing
in October, 1535, Lord Butler's march for the recovery of
Dungarvan Castle, says, "We were met by his lordship's
brother-in-law, Gerald Mac Shane, (Fitzgerald) Lord of the
Decies, who, though a very strong man in his country, could
speak never a word of English, but made the troops good cheer
after the gentilest fashion that could be. All this journey from
Dungarvan forth there is none alive that can remember that
English man of war was ever in these parts." Still more
striking is the statement that in the Dublin parliament of
1541, all the peers except Mac Gillapatric were of Norman or
English descent, and yet not one except the Earl of Ormond
could understand English.<a name="FNanchor_5_872" id="FNanchor_5_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_872" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A letter to the English Privy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
Council, written in 1569, by Dominicke Linche, of Galway,
confirms this. "Even they of the best houses," he writes,
"the brothers of the Erle of Clanrickarde, yea and one of his
uncles, and he a bysshop, can neither speak nor understand
in manner any thinge of their Prince's language, which
language by the old Statutes of Galway, every man ought to
learn and must speak before he can be admitted to any office
within the Corporation."<a name="FNanchor_6_873" id="FNanchor_6_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_873" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Nor had the extirpating policy succeeded even in the Pale,
for we read in the State Papers that in the county of Kildare
in 1534, "there is not one husbandman in effect that speaketh
English nor useth any English sort nor manner, and their
gentlemen be after the same sort."<a name="FNanchor_7_874" id="FNanchor_7_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_874" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The great Earl of Kildare had nearly as many volumes of
Irish as he had of English in his library. A catalogue of his
books was drawn up in 1518. Amongst the Irish manuscripts
were St. Berachán's book,<a name="FNanchor_8_875" id="FNanchor_8_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_875" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the Speech of Oyncheaghis (?)
Cuchuland's Acts, the History of Clone Lyre, etc. Murchadh
O'Brien, king of Thomond, promised Henry VIII. as early as
1547, when in London, that he and his heirs should use the
English habit and manner, and to their knowledge the English
language, and to their power bring up their children in the
same.<a name="FNanchor_9_876" id="FNanchor_9_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_876" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And indeed that family seems to have been always the
greatest prop of the English power in the South of Ireland.
Thomas Moore, settling in Ireland in 1575, got his lands in
King's County on the condition that his sons and servants
"should use for the most the English tongue, habit, and
government," and make no appeals to the Brehon law. Three
years after this, in 1578, we find Lord Chancellor Gerard
affirming that all the English, and the most part with delight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
<i>even in Dublin</i> speak Irish, and greatly are spotted in manners,
habit, and conditions with Irish stains.<a name="FNanchor_10_877" id="FNanchor_10_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_877" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In the Vatican Library my friend Father Hogan found a
MS. of about the year 1580 with a memorandum concerning
certain Franciscan friars, three of whom spoke Irish only,
including the Provincial who <i>preached all over Ireland</i>, five
more knew Irish better than English, while five are entered as
knowing English better than Irish, none are entered as knowing
English only.</p>

<p>In 1585 the Irish chieftains of Hy Many, the O'Kellys
country, agreed that "Teige mac William O'Kelly and Conor
Oge O'Kelly shall henceforth behave themselves like good
subjects and shall bring up their children after the English
fashions and in the use of the English tongue."<a name="FNanchor_11_878" id="FNanchor_11_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_878" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Of course
such enforced promises had no effect. We find in the State
Papers that at St. Douay in 1600 were sixty young gentlemen,
eldest sons of the principal gentlemen of the Pale, and that they
all spoke Irish.<a name="FNanchor_12_879" id="FNanchor_12_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_879" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In 1608 it was found that the superior of the Irish Jesuits,
apparently a Pales-man, Father Christopher Holywood of
Artane, near Dublin, could speak no Irish, and a document
was sent at once to the General of the Jesuits, pointing out
how this destroyed his usefulness in the Irish mission. Care
was taken that the same mistake should not be made in
appointing his successor, Robert Nugent.<a name="FNanchor_13_880" id="FNanchor_13_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_880" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In 1609 we find Richard Conway, a Jesuit, writing that the
English in Ireland took care that all [their own] children are
taught English and chastise them if they speak their own
native tongue<a name="FNanchor_14_881" id="FNanchor_14_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_881" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> (<i>sic</i>). Five or six years later Father Stephen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
White writes, "Scarcely one in a thousand of the old Irish
know even three words of any tongue except Irish, the
modern Irish learn to speak Irish and English."<a name="FNanchor_15_882" id="FNanchor_15_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_882" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless the cause of the English language cannot have
much progressed during the next fifty years, for we find in
1657 a petition presented to the Municipal Council of Dublin
to the effect that "whereas by the laws all persons ought to
speak and use the English tongue and habit,&mdash;contrary whereunto
and in open contempt thereof, there is Irish commonly
and usually spoken and the Irish habit worn not only in the
streets and by such as live in the country and come to this city
on market days, but also by and in several families in this city,
to the scandalising of the inhabitants and magistrates of this
city. And whereas there is much of swearing and cursing
used and practised (as in the English tongue too much, so also
in the Irish tongue)," etc. Irish, indeed, seems to have been
the commonest language in Dublin at this time. James
Howel in a letter written August 9, in 1630, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some curious in the comparisons of tongues, say Irish is a dialect
of the ancient British, and the learnedest of that nation in a private
discourse I happened to have with him seemed to incline to this
opinion, but I can assure your Lordship I found a great multitude of
their radical words the same with the Welsh, both for sense and
sound. The tone also of both nations is consonant, for when I first
walked up and down the Dublin markets methought I was in Wales
when I listened to their speech. I found the Irish tone a little more
querulous and whining than the British, which I conjecture proceeded
from their often being subjugated by the English."</p></blockquote>

<p>During the Cromwellian wars most of the members of the
Confederation of Kilkenny who took the side of the Nuncio
Rinuccini knew little if anything of the English language,
"qui," says Rinuccini in his MSS., "boni publici zelo flagrarent,
plerique linguam quidem Ibernicam quia vernaculam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>
bene, sed Anglicam male vel nullo modo callerent." When
an order was issued by the Supreme Council for the new oath
of association to be translated from English into Irish by each
bishop for his diocese, it was found upon inquiry that some
of the bishops did not understand a word of English. The
Nuncio appears to have been very much impressed by the
sweetness of the Irish language, but he had not leisure to
devote himself to the study of it. Some of the Italian
members of his household, however, became complete masters
of it. Numbers of the poor people who had been plundered
by the soldiery came to complain to him of their losses, and he
notes in his diary that their wail and lamentation in Irish was
far more plaintive and expressive than any music of the great
masters which he had ever heard among the more favoured
nations of the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_16_883" id="FNanchor_16_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_883" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Irish was at this time the usual "vehicle of business and of
negociation with the natives, even amongst the learned," as we
see in Carte's life of the Duke of Ormond, who was born in
England in 1607 and educated as a Protestant by the Archbishop
of Canterbury.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Duke," says Carte, "when about twenty or twenty-four years
of age learned the Irish language by conversing with such Irish
gentlemen as spoke it in London; he understood it perfectly well
and could express himself well enough in familiar conversation, but
considered himself not so well qualified as to discourse about serious
matters; he afterwards on many occasions found himself at a great
loss, as he had to negociate business of national importance with
gentlemen who were far less intelligent in the English language than
he was in the Irish. On such occasions he would use the same
methods which he took with the titular bishop of Clogher, the great
favourite of Owen O'Neil, and successor to that general in the
command of the Ulster forces. This bishop he brought over to the
king's interest, and gained his entire confidence by a conversation
carried on between both parties in private. The Duke always spoke
in English and the bishop in Irish, as neither understood the language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
of the other so as to venture upon communicating his sentiments in
it with any degree of accuracy or precision."<a name="FNanchor_17_884" id="FNanchor_17_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_884" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Irish themselves never neglected literature, and whenever
their political star was in the ascendant the fortunes of
their bards and learned men rose with it. Thus we find Rory
O'More, the close friend of Owen Roe O'Neill, and the chief
of the O'Mores of Leix, engaged in 1642 in an attempt to
re-establish Irish schools and learning, and writing on the 20th
of September, 1642, to Father Hugh de Bourgo at Brussels,
"If we may, before Flan Mac Egan dies, we will see an Irish
school opened, and therefore would wish heartily that these
learned and religious fathers in Louvain would come over in
haste with their monuments (?) and an Irish and Latin press."
The Mac Egan here alluded to was the eminent Brehon and
Irish antiquarian who lived at Bally-mac-Egan in the county
Tipperary in Lower Ormond, whose imprimatur was considered
so valuable that the Four Masters procured for their
work his written approbation.<a name="FNanchor_18_885" id="FNanchor_18_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_885" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Seven years after this letter,
the town of Wexford, from which O'More wrote in the
interests of humanity and learning, sank in fire and ruin and
its inhabitants both men and women were put to the sword in
one universal massacre.</p>

<p>There were in the year 1650, forty-seven Jesuit priests in
Ireland, according to a memorandum given me by Father
Hogan, S.J., of these two&mdash;one from Meath the other from
Kerry&mdash;spoke Irish only: and four from Dublin, all of course
of English extraction, spoke English only, while the remaining
forty-one spoke both languages. Seven of these bi-linguists
were from Dublin and ten from Meath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span></p>

<p>These instances show that Irish was the usual spoken
language of the country, even in Dublin, but there are indications
that the ardour with which it had been cultivated and the
respect with which its professors had been regarded was dying
out. Even as early as 1627 we find one Connla Mac Echagan
of West Meath, translating the "Annals of Clonmacnois"
into English,<a name="FNanchor_19_886" id="FNanchor_19_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_886" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and in his dedication to his friend and kinsman
Torlogh Mac Cochlan, lord of Delvin, he says that formerly
many septs lived in Ireland whose profession it was to chronicle
and keep in memory the state of the kingdom, but, he adds,
"now as they cannot enjoy that respect and gain by their
profession, as heretofore they and their ancestors received, they
set nought by the said knowledge, neglect their books, and
choose rather to put their children to learn English than their
own native language, insomuch that some of them suffer
tailors to cut the leaves of the said books (which their ancestors
held in great account) and sew them in long pieces to
make their measures of, [so] that the posterities are like to fall
into more ignorance of many things which happened before
their time."</p>

<p>A little later, in 1639, Father Stapleton, in his "Doctrina
Christiana," published in Irish and Latin&mdash;the first Irish book
ever printed in Roman characters&mdash;throws the blame for the
neglect of Irish literature first upon the Irish antiquarians "who
have placed it under difficulties and hard words,<a name="FNanchor_20_887" id="FNanchor_20_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_887" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> writing it in
mysterious ways, and in dark difficult language," and secondly
upon the upper classes "who bring their native natural language
(which is powerful, perfect, honourable, learned, and sharply-exact
in itself) into contempt and disrespect, and spend their
time cultivating and learning other foreign tongues."<a name="FNanchor_21_888" id="FNanchor_21_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_888" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter Lombard, Archbishop of Armagh, in his book printed
at Louvain in 1632, says that Irish is the language of the whole
of Hibernia, but there were some differences of pronunciation
in the various provinces, and between the learned and the
common people, the universal opinion being that the people
of Connacht spoke it best, they having both power of expression
and propriety of phrase, while the men of Munster had
the power of expression without the propriety, and the people
of Ulster the propriety without the power of expression. The
people of Leinster were considered deficient in both.<a name="FNanchor_22_889" id="FNanchor_22_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_889" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>O'Molloy in his "Lochrann na gCreidmheach," published
in 1675, says that "no language is well understood by the
common people of the island except Irish alone."<a name="FNanchor_23_890" id="FNanchor_23_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_890" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The
students of the Irish College at Rome were at this time bound
by rule to speak Irish, and an Irish book was to be read in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
refectory during dinner and supper,<a name="FNanchor_24_891" id="FNanchor_24_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_891" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and all candidates for the
priesthood were directed by the Synod of Tuam, in 1660, to
learn to read and write Irish well.</p>

<p>Sir William Petty, writing in 1672, has an interesting passage
on the people of Wexford and of Fingal: "The language
of Ireland is like that of the North of Scotland, in many
things like the Welsh and Manques, but in Ireland the Fingallians"
[the dwellers along the coast some miles north of
Dublin] "speak neither English, Irish, nor Welsh, and the
people about Wexford, though they speak in a language differing
from English, Welsh, and Irish, yet it is not the same with
that of the Fingallians near Dublin. Both these sorts of people
are honest and laborious members of the kingdom." Petty's
strictures upon the Irish language, of which he was utterly
ignorant, and which he ludicrously asserts "to have few
words," need not here be noticed. He appears to show, however,
that the Irish had already begun to borrow some words
from English, and expressed many of the "names of artificial
things" in "the language of their conquerors by altering the
termination and language only."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It need hardly be said that once the English Government
got the upper hand in the seventeenth century, and placed
bishops and clergy of its own in the sees and dioceses throughout
Ireland, they made it a kind of understood bargain with
their nominees that they should have no dealings and make
no terms with the national Irish language. Bedell, who
was an Englishman and had been created an Irish bishop,
neglected this unwritten compact far enough to learn Irish
himself and to translate, with the help of a couple of Irishmen,
the Bible into Irish, and he also circulated a catechism in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
English and Irish amongst the natives. He reaped his reward
in the undying gratitude of the Irish and the equally bitter
animosity of his own colleagues. Ussher, then primate, in
answer to a pathetic letter of Bedell's asking what were the
charges against him, said in his reply, "the course which you
took with the Papists was generally cried out against, neither
do I remember in all my life that anything was done here by
any of us, at which the professors of the gospel did take more
offense, or by which the adversaries were more confirmed in
their superstitions and idolatry, whereas I wish you had advised
with your brethren before you would aventure to pull down
that which they have been so long a building,"<a name="FNanchor_25_892" id="FNanchor_25_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_892" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> meaning the
discrediting and destruction of the Irish language. The Irish,
however, did not forget the efforts Bedell had made in behalf
of their tongue, for, having taken him prisoner in the war of
1648, they treated him with every courtesy in their power, and
when he died their troops fired a volley over his grave, crying
out, <i>Requiescat ultimus Anglorum</i>, while a priest who was
present was heard to exclaim with fervour, "<i>Sit anima mea cum
Bedelo</i>."</p>

<p>Indeed, the attitude adopted by the Government and the
bishops who were its loyal henchmen, placed the defenders of
the Established Church in a very awkward and embarrassing
position. They wanted to make Protestants of the people,
but they could not talk to them nor preach to them. The
only possible course for the bishops to pursue, supposing them
to have been in earnest, and to have been ecclesiastics and not
Government place-men, would have been to appoint Irish-speaking
clergy under them, a thing which with scarcely an
exception they utterly and obstinately refused to do. So that
for a hundred and fifty years the native inhabitants of Ireland
were obliged to pay a tenth of their produce to a foreign
clergy whom they could not understand and who never
troubled themselves to understand them. How gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
and scholars like Ussher could take up the position they did,
is marvellous. He declares with one breath that "the religion
of the Papists is superstitious and idolatrous, their faith and
doctrines erroneous and heretical, their church in respect of
both apostatical, to give them therefore a toleration, or to consent
that they may freely exercise their religion and profess
their faith and doctrine is a grievous sin,"<a name="FNanchor_26_893" id="FNanchor_26_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_893" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and with the next
breath he tells Bedell when he circulated books in the Irish
language meant to convert these same Papists, that nothing
was ever done "at which the professors of the gospel did take
more offense." This can only be accounted for, so far as I
can see, by strong social prejudice and race hatred. The
desire to see the Irish and their language crushed and <i>in
extremis</i> was stronger than the desire to make Protestants
of them, and this feeling continued for at least a hundred and
fifty years.<a name="FNanchor_27_894" id="FNanchor_27_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_894" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Even so late as the latter half of the eighteenth
century we find Dr. Woodward, Protestant bishop of Cloyne,
stating that "the difference of language is a very general (and
where it obtains an <i>insurmountable</i>) object to any intercourse
with the people," on the part of the Protestant clergy, but, he
adds coolly, "if it be asked why the clergy do not learn the
Irish language, I answer that it should be the object of
Government rather to take measures to bring it into entire
disuse,"<a name="FNanchor_28_895" id="FNanchor_28_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_895" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> one of the most cynical avowals I can remember on
the part of an Irish prelate as to what he was there for&mdash;not
for the spiritual good of the people who paid him tithes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
but as the official tool of the Government to crush their
nationality.</p>

<p>Even Dean Swift, so clear-sighted a politician where
Ireland's financial wrongs were concerned, was in his policy
towards the people's language quite at one with men like
Ussher and Woodward. Yet he knew perfectly well that over
three-fourths of the island he and his <i>confrères</i> were, so far as
polemical arguments or conversion went, powerless either for
good or evil. He was, like the other Protestant dignitaries
of his day, a declared enemy of the Gaelic speech, which he
considered prevented "the Irish from being tamed," and at
one time he said he had a scheme by which their language
"might <i>easily</i> be abolished and become a dead one in half an
age, with little expense and less trouble." In another place he
says, "it would be a noble achievement to abolish the Irish
language in the kingdom, so far at least as to oblige all the
natives to speak only English on every occasion of business, in
shops, markets, fairs, and other places of dealing: yet I am
wholly deceived if this might not be effectually done in less
than half an age and at a very trifling expense; for such I look
upon a tax to be, of only six thousand pounds to accomplish
so great a work." Whatever the Dean's plan was, he did not
further enlighten the public upon it, and the scheme appears to
have died with him.</p>

<p>The absorbing power of Irish nationality continued so
strong all through the seventeenth century that according to
Prendergast many of the children of Oliver Cromwell's
soldiers who had settled in Ireland could not speak a word of
English.<a name="FNanchor_29_896" id="FNanchor_29_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_896" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It was the same all over the country. In 1760
Irish was so universally spoken in the regiments of the Irish
Brigade that Dick Hennessy, Edmund Burke's cousin, learnt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
it on foreign service.<a name="FNanchor_30_897" id="FNanchor_30_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_897" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Still later, during the Peninsular War,
the English officers in one of the Highland regiments
attempted to abolish the speaking of Gaelic at the mess table,
but the Gaelic-speaking officers completely outvoted them.
Irish was spoken at this time by <i>all the Milesian families of
high rank</i>, except when they wished to deliberately Anglicise
themselves. Michael Kelly, the musical composer and
vocalist, who was born in Dublin in 1764, tells us in his
"Reminiscences:"<a name="FNanchor_31_898" id="FNanchor_31_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_898" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I procured an audience of the Emperor of Germany at Schoenbrunn,
and found him with a half-dozen of general officers, among
whom were Generals O'Donnell and Kavanagh, my gallant countrymen.
The latter [he was from Borris in the Queen's County] said
something to me in Irish which I did not understand, consequently
made him no answer. The Emperor turned quickly on me and
said, 'What! O'Kelly, don't you speak the language of your own
country?' I replied, 'Please, your Majesty, none but the lower
orders of the Irish people speak Irish.' The Emperor laughed
loudly. The impropriety of the remark made before two Milesian
Generals flashed into my mind in an instant, and I could have bitten
off my tongue. They luckily did not, or pretended not to hear."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is from the middle of the eighteenth century onward that
the Irish language begins to die out. I doubt whether before
that period any Milesian family either in Ireland or the Scotch
Highlands spoke English in its own home or to its own
children.</p>

<p>I have been at much pains to trace the decay of the language,
and the extent to which it has been spoken at various periods
from that day to this, and have consulted all the volumes of
travellers and statisticians upon which I have been able to lay
hands. The result, however, has not been very satisfactory
so far as information goes. It is simply amazing that most
Irish and many English writers, who have had to deal with
Ireland from that day to this, have in their sketchy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
generally unreliable accounts of the island, its people, and its
social conditions, simply ignored the fact that any other
language than English was spoken in it at all. Perhaps the
most trustworthy accounts of the anomalous condition of the
Irish-speaking race in their own island are by foreigners who
have recorded what they saw without prejudice one way or
the other, whereas one cannot help thinking that English and
Irish writers who, while going over the same ground, have
yet absolutely ignored<a name="FNanchor_32_899" id="FNanchor_32_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_899" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> all allusion to the question of language,
did so because they found it a difficult and awkward question
to deal with.</p>

<p>The first authorities I know of who speak of Irish as dying
out are Dr. Samuel Madden, who, writing in 1738, states
that not one in twenty was ignorant of English, and Harris,
who, in his description of the county Down six years later,
says that Irish prevailed only amongst the poorer Catholics.
Both these statements, however, are preposterously exaggerated.
In the very year that Madden wrote died O'Neill of Clanaboy,
one of the best-known and most influential men of the county
Down, and I found in the Belfast Museum the Irish manuscript
of the funeral oration pronounced over his body,<a name="FNanchor_33_900" id="FNanchor_33_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_900" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and any
O'Neill would probably at that period have turned in his
grave had his funeral discourse been spoken in English.</p>

<p>Madden's statement that in 1738 nineteenth-twentieths of
the population knew English is an incredible one and so utterly
disproved by all the other evidence, that it is astonishing that
so sound and careful a historian as Mr. Lecky should have
accepted it as substantially true. The evidence upon the other
side is overwhelming. Forty-seven years after Madden wrote
this the German, Küttner, travelling through Ireland, wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
a series of letters in which he distinctly says that he found the
common people either did not understand English at all or
understood it imperfectly.<a name="FNanchor_34_901" id="FNanchor_34_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_901" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>More than two generations had passed away after Madden's
statement that nineteen-twentieths of the population knew
English, when we find a Scotchman, Daniel Dewar, in a book
entitled "Observations on the Character, Customs and Superstitions
of the Irish," writing thus in 1812:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The number of people who speak this language [Irish] is much
greater than is generally supposed. It is spoken throughout the
province of Connaught by all the lower orders, a great part of whom
scarcely understand any English, and some of those who do, understand
it only so as to conduct business. They are incapable of
receiving moral or religious instruction through its medium. The
Irish is spoken very generally through the other three provinces
except amongst the descendants of the Scotch in the north. It
cannot be supposed that calculations on this subject should be
perfectly accurate, but it has been concluded on good grounds that
there are about two millions of people in Ireland [out of about six
millions] who are incapable of understanding a continued discourse
in English."</p></blockquote>

<p>"I have always found," says Dewar, with much shrewdness,
"that in places where gentlemen hostile to this tongue assured
me there was not a word of it spoken, in these very districts
I heard very little English." He gives an amusing account
of the various contradictory objections that he found at that
time urged against it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some of the Anglo-Hibernians at that time (1808) strongly maintained
that this dialect is so barbarous that it cannot answer the
purpose of instruction, others that it would awaken the enthusiasm
of the <i>Wild Irish</i> (as they call them) to make any attempt of this kind,
and consequently that it might prove dangerous to the Government,
and others, that they had no desire to be taught in Irish, and that it
would be useless to send teachers among them for this purpose."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span></p>

<p>Dutton, in his statistical history of the county Clare, published
in 1808, says that almost all the gentlemen of that county spoke
Irish with the country people, but he adds, "scarcely one of
their sons is able to hold a conversation in this language. The
children of almost all those who cannot speak English are
proud of being spoken to in English and answering in the
same, even although you may question them in Irish. No Irish
is spoken in any of the schools, and the peasants are anxious to
send their children to them to learn English." This apparently
does not refer to the hedge schools of the natives, but to the
charter and other English schools. "I think the diversity
of language and not the diversity of religion," writes Grattan,
in 1811, "constitutes a diversity of people. I should be very
sorry that the Irish language should be forgotten, but glad that
the English language should be generally understood."<a name="FNanchor_35_902" id="FNanchor_35_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_902" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> This
seems to have been also the position taken up by his great rival
Flood, who, when dying, left some £50,000 to Trinity College
for the cultivation of the Irish language. Trinity College,
however, never secured the money, and its so-called Irish
professorship, lately established, in the fifties, is only an
adjunct of its Divinity School, and paid and practically
controlled, not by the college, nor by people in the least interested
in the cultivation of Celtic literature, but by a society for
the conversion of Irish Papists through the medium of their
own language.</p>

<p>In 1825, that is eighty-seven years after Madden's statement
that nineteen-twentieths of the population knew English, the
Commissioners of Education in Ireland, in their first report laid
before Parliament, state "it has been estimated that the number
of Irish who employ the ancient language of the country
exclusively is not less than 500,000, and that at least a million
more, although they have some understanding of English and
can employ it for the ordinary purposes of traffic, make use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
of their [own] tongue on all other occasions as the natural
vehicle of their thoughts."</p>

<p>Lappenberg, a German who travelled in Ireland, reckoned
that out of a population of seven millions of inhabitants in 1835,
four millions spoke Irish "als ihre Muttersprache."</p>

<p>In 1842 Mac Comber's "Christian Remembrancer," discussing
the possibility of "converting" the Irish, says, "there
are about 3,000,000 of Irish who still speak the Irish language
and love it as their mother tongue," and "that part of the
Irish population which still speaks and understands little else
than Irish" is "nearly a third of the entire population of
Ireland."</p>

<p>A German, J. C. Kohl, who travelled extensively in Ireland
in 1843, shortly before the famine, says that in Clare the
"children would run by the side of the car crying, 'Burnocks<a name="FNanchor_36_903" id="FNanchor_36_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_903" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
halfpenny,' burnocks being an appellation applied to every
stranger, and 'halfpenny' the only English that the little
rogues seemed to know." The neglect of the use of Irish in
the churches, which had even then set in, largely owing to the
teaching and wishes of O'Connell and his parliamentarians,
struck the German spectator as something astonishing, for
apparently he could not understand how an ancient nation
with whose fame all Europe had recently been filled owing
to the exertions of O'Connell, should be casting away its
national birthright. "The great city of Cork," he notes,
"which lies in a district where much Irish is still spoken,
contains only two churches where sermons are preached in
Irish. A short time ago the Irish prisoners in Cork gaol
petitioned the chaplain that he would preach his Sunday
sermon to them in Irish."</p>

<p>This acute foreign observer gives a very interesting account
of the state of the Irish language round Drogheda, a coast town
some twenty miles north of Dublin, which is worth quoting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>
here since it accurately describes the condition of affairs over
the greater part of Leinster sixty years ago, but which is now
so absolutely extinct that few modern Irishmen could believe it
except on the most unimpeachable testimony. "Drogheda,"
he writes, "is the last genuine Irish town, the suburbs of
Drogheda are genuine Irish suburbs ... and a great many
people are to be found in the neighbourhood who speak the
old Irish tongue more fluently and more frequently than
the English." Kohl was hospitably entertained by a priest
in Drogheda&mdash;whose name unfortunately he does not mention,
but who appears to have been a man of superior
intelligence. His house had several harps in it, and he was
delighted by a young blind harper who first played Brian
Boru's march for him, and then an air called the Fairy Queen.
At Kohl's request the priest also sent for a reciter of Irish
poetry, who asked what he would wish recited. "If you
were to repeat all you know," said the priest, "we should
have to listen all night, I suppose, and many other nights as
well."</p>

<p>"The man," says Kohl, "began to recite and went on
uninterruptedly for a quarter of an hour. His story, of which
I, of course, understood not a word, but which my friendly
host afterwards explained to me, treated of a Scottish
enchantress named Aithura,<a name="FNanchor_37_904" id="FNanchor_37_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_904" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> who forsaken by her Irish
lover, Cuchullin, laid a cruel spell upon his son Konnell
which compelled him by an irresistible enchantment, and
entirely against his will, to follow, to persecute, to fight, and
at last to destroy his father, Cuchullin. At the last moment,
after stabbing his father to the heart in spite of the efforts by
which he struggled to resist the horrible impulse of his destiny,
his own heart broke in the struggle, and he and his father died
together, while the revengeful spirit of the cruel enchantress

treacherous lover the story of his inconstancy and her revenge."
"I was glad," adds Kohl, "of assuring myself by oral demonstration
of the actual existence of Ossianic poetry like this, at
the present day. The reciter was, as I have said, a simple and
ignorant man, with a good deal of the clown about him, and
his recitation was as simple, unadorned, and undeclamatory as
himself. Sometimes, however, when carried away by the
interest of his story his manner and voice were animated and
moving. At such times he fixed his eyes on his hearers as if
demanding their sympathy and admiration for himself and his
poem. Sometimes I noticed that the metre completely changed,
and I was told that this was the case with all Irish poems, for
that the metre was always made to suit the subject.<a name="FNanchor_38_905" id="FNanchor_38_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_905" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> I also
heard that the most beautiful part of this ballad was the
dialogue of father and son upon the battlefield, but that
a prose translation would give me no idea at all of its
beauty."</p>

<p>The priest told him that "Ossianic poetry was very abundant
in the neighbourhood of Drogheda." "This," he says, "I
had heard before, and from all I heard in Ireland I am much
inclined to believe&mdash;which indeed many have also conjectured&mdash;that
Macpherson obtained the materials for his version of
Ossian's poems from popular tradition and ballads of the
North of Ireland. The whole Irish nation both in the
south and north, is certainly much more imbued with the
spirit of this poetry and still possesses many more traces
of it than the Scottish people, whether of the Highlands or
Lowlands."<a name="FNanchor_39_906" id="FNanchor_39_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_906" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span></p>

<p>Another very acute German traveller, Rodenberg, describes
the people of Kerry as always speaking Irish among themselves
in 1860, while their English was so bad that he could hardly
understand it. He notices, however, that several words of corrupted
English were interwoven with their Irish conversation,
which so disgusted him that he remarks, "everything about
these people is patchwork, their clothing, their dwellings, their
language."<a name="FNanchor_40_907" id="FNanchor_40_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_907" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He reports at full length a most interesting conversation
which he had with a priest near Limerick, who
assured him that they had to pull down in order to build up,
that is, pull down the edifice of the Irish language in which the
people were denied education in order to build up a new education
in the English language. "Nor is it," said the priest,
"the first time that the Irishman has had to turn his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
against his most sacred things. Red Hugh of Donegal destroyed
the house of his forefathers that the enemy might not
make of it a fortress against his own people, but he wept while
he destroyed it."<a name="FNanchor_41_908" id="FNanchor_41_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_908" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>In the Galway fish market Rodenberg could not hear a single
word of English spoken. The population of Connacht was at
this time a little unnder a million, and the census of 1861
showed that about one-tenth of the whole population were
ignorant of English. The population of the city of Galway
in this year was 23,787, of whom 3,511 were ignorant of
English.</p>

<p>According to the census of 1891 something over three-quarters
of a million people in Ireland were bi-linguists, and
66,140 could speak Irish only, thus showing that in thirty
years Irish was killed off so rapidly <i>that the whole Island contained
fewer speakers in 1891 than the small province of
Connacht alone did thirty years before</i>.</p>

<p>This extinguishing of the Irish language has not been the
result of a natural process of decay, but has been chiefly caused
by the definite policy of the Board of "National Education,"
as it is called, backed by the expenditure every year of many
hundreds of thousands of pounds. This Board, evidently
actuated by a false sense of Imperialism, and by an overmastering
desire to centralise, and being itself appointed by
Government chiefly from a class of Irishmen who have been
steadily hostile to the natives, and being perfectly ignorant of
the language and literature of the Irish, have pursued from the
first with unvarying pertinacity the great aim of utterly exterminating
this fine Aryan language.</p>

<p>The amount of horrible suffering entailed by this policy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
the amount of hopeless ignorance stereotyped in hundreds of
thousands of children, and the ruination of the life-prospects of
hundreds of thousands more, by insisting upon their growing
up unable to read or write, sooner than teach them to read and
write the only language they knew, has counted for nothing
with the Board of National Education, compared with their
great object of the extermination of the Irish language, and
the attainment of one Anglified uniformity. In vain have their
own inspectors time after time testified to the ill results of
denying the Irish-speakers education in their own language, in
vain have disinterested visitors opened wide eyes of astonishment
at schoolmasters who knew no Irish being appointed to
teach pupils<a name="FNanchor_42_909" id="FNanchor_42_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_909" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> who know no English. In vain have the schoolmasters
themselves petitioned to be allowed to change the
system, in vain did Sir Patrick Keenan (afterwards himself
Chief Commissioner of National Education) address the Board
saying, "the shrewdest people in the world are those who are
bi-lingual, borderers have always been remarkable in this respect,
but <i>the most stupid children I have ever met with</i> are those who
were learning English while endeavouring to forget Irish.
The real policy of the educationist would in my opinion be to
teach Irish grammatically and soundly to the Irish-speaking
people, <i>and then</i> to teach them English through the medium of
their native language."<a name="FNanchor_43_910" id="FNanchor_43_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_910" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> All in vain! Against the steady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
unwavering, unrelenting determination to stamp out the Irish
language which has been paramount in the Board ever since the
days of Archbishop Whately, every representation passed unheeded,
and it would appear that in another generation the
Board&mdash;at the cost of unparalleled suffering&mdash;will have attained
its object.</p>

<p>This is not the place to discuss the bearings of this question
still less to drag in the names of individuals, but the
reader who has followed the history of Irish literature to
this will be perhaps anxious to have it continued up to
date, and so I may as well here place on record what I and
many others have seen with our own eyes over and over
again.</p>

<p>An Irish-speaking family, endowed with all the usual intelligence
of the Irish-speaking population, with a gift for song,
poetry, Ossianic lays, traditional history, and story, send their
children to school. A rational education, such as any self-governing
country in Europe would give them, would teach
them to read and write the language that they spoke, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
their fathers had read and spoken for fifteen hundred years before
them. The exigencies of life in the United Kingdom would
then make it necessary to teach them a second language&mdash;English.
The basis of knowledge upon which they started,
and which they had acquired as naturally as the breath of life,
would in any fair system of education be kept as a basis,
and their education would be built up upon it. They would
be taught to <i>read</i> the Ossianics lays which they knew by heart
before, they would be given books containing more of the same
sort, they would be taught to read the poems, and they would
have put into their hands books of prose and poetry of a kindred
nature. They had picked up many items of information about
the history of Ireland from their fathers and mothers, they
would be given a simple history of Ireland to read. All this
they would assimilate naturally and quickly because it would
be the natural continuation of what they already in part
possessed. But the exigencies of life in the United Kingdom
makes it necessary to read English poems and English books,
and to know something of English history also, this they
would learn after the other.</p>

<p>Will it be believed, the Board of National Education insists
upon the Irish-speaking child starting out from the first
moment <i>to learn to read a language it does not speak</i>.<a name="FNanchor_44_911" id="FNanchor_44_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_911" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It is
forbidden to be taught one syllable of Irish, easy sentences,
poems, or anything else. It is forbidden to be taught one word
of Irish history. Advantage is taken of <i>nothing</i> that the child
knew before or that came natural to it, and the result is
appalling.</p>

<p>Bright-eyed intelligent children, second in intelligence, I
should think, to none in Europe, with all the traditional traits
of a people cultured for fifteen hundred years, children endowed
with a vocabulary in every-day use of about three thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
words<a name="FNanchor_45_912" id="FNanchor_45_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_912" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> (while the ordinary English peasant has often not more
than five hundred) enter the schools of the Chief Commissioner,
to come out at the end with all their natural vivacity gone, their
intelligence almost completely sapped, their splendid command
of their native language lost for ever, and a vocabulary of five
or six hundred English words, badly pronounced and barbarously
employed, substituted for it, and this they in their
turn will transmit to their children, while everything that
they knew on entering the school, story, lay, poem, song,
aphorism, proverb, and the unique stock-in-trade of an Irish
speaker's mind, is gone for ever, <i>and replaced by nothing</i>.</p>

<p>I have long looked and inquired in vain, on all hands, for
any possible justification of this system, and the more I have
looked and inquired the more convinced I am that none such
exists unless it be an unacknowledged political one. Its
results at all events are only too obvious. The children are
taught, if nothing else, to be ashamed of their own parents,
ashamed of their own nationality, ashamed of their own names.
The only idea of education they now have is connected
not with the literary past of their own nation, but with the
new board-trained schoolmaster and his school, which to
them represent the only possible form of knowledge. They
have no idea of anything outside of, or beyond, this. Hence
they allow their beautiful Irish manuscripts to rot<a name="FNanchor_46_913" id="FNanchor_46_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_913" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>&mdash;because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
the schoolmaster does not read Irish. They never sing an
Irish song or repeat an Irish poem&mdash;the schoolmaster does
not; they forget all about their own country that their
parents told them&mdash;the schoolmaster <i>is not allowed to teach
Irish history</i>; they translate their names into English&mdash;probably
the schoolmaster has done the same; and what is the
use of having an Irish name now that they are not allowed to
speak Irish! Worst of all they have not only dropped their
Irish Christian names, but they are becoming ashamed of the
patron saints of their own people, the names even of Patrick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
and of Brigit.<a name="FNanchor_47_914" id="FNanchor_47_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_914" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It is a remarkable system of education, and
one well worth the minutest study that can be paid it, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
is able to produce these effects, but with even the smallest
philological regard for the meaning of words, it cannot be
called "education."</p>

means extinct in Ireland, and his testimony appears quite disinterested
and trustworthy. "I afterwards heard," he says, "that piece (The Fairy
Queen) on the pianoforte, but it did not sound half so soft and sweet as
from the instrument of this blind young harper.... We were very much
delighted with our harper who was certainly an accomplished artist, yet
Ireland contains many of still greater ability and celebrity. The most
celebrated of all, however, is a man named Byrne, blind also if I do not
mistake. When, therefore, Moore sings&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'The harp that once through Tara's hall</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The soul of music shed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now hangs as mute on Tara's wall</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As if the soul were fled,'</span><br />
</p>
<p>
"his lamentation must not be literally understood." He also mentions
that when he was in Drogheda "a concert was in preparation to be
given next week at which seven harpers, mostly blind, were to play
together."
</p>
<p>
An English tourist, C. R. Wild ["Vacations in Ireland," London, 1857],
mentions meeting a harper at Leenane in Connemara in 1857, who
requested permission to play to him during his meal. He describes him
as "an ancient man bearing a small Irish harp such as were common in
olden days; ... the music produced was, for the most part, plaintive and
slow, and the tones particularly soft and melodious." The priest who
entertained Kohl had a number of harps in his house, but, unfortunately,
the German says nothing of their size or shape. From these instances
it would appear that the race of Irish harpers did not quite die out with
those who assembled at Belfast at the close of the last century when
Bunting secured so many of their airs, but that some lingered on till
after the famine. How far these latter harpers could be regarded as the
genuine descendants of the old race is doubtful.</p></div>

National Schoolmasters themselves as early as 1874 in their Congress
unanimously passed the following resolution:&mdash;"The peasants in Irish-speaking
districts have not English enough to convey their ideas,
except such as relate to the mechanical business of their occupation.
Hence they are not able in any degree to cultivate or impress the minds of
their children (though often very intelligent themselves), who consequently
grow up dull and stupid if they have been suffered to lose the Irish language
or to drop out of the constant practice of it." This is <i>exactly</i> what I
and every other spectator have found, and it means that the Board of
National Education is engaged in replacing an intelligent generation of
men by an utterly stupid and unintelligent one.</p></div>

Educational system in Ireland, and was employed by the Government to
report upon the plan of teaching the people of Malta in Maltese, reported
to Parliament that the attempt to substitute English or Italian for Maltese
in the schools was a fatal one. "Such a course would simply mean that
the people are to get no chance, much less choice, of acquiring a
knowledge either of their own or any other language." This is
exactly true of spots in Ireland, and after his experiences in Donegal,
Sir Patrick Keenan drew up the following memorial:&mdash;"1. That the
Irish-speaking people ought to be taught the Irish language grammatically,
and that school books in Irish should be prepared for the
purpose. 2. That English should be taught to all Irish-speaking
children through the medium of the Irish. 3. That if this system be
pursued the people will be very soon better educated than they are
now, or possibly can be <i>for many generations</i> upon the present system.
And 4. That the English language will in a short time be more
generally and purely spoken than it can be by the present system for
many generations." When he became head of the National System of
Education, Sir Patrick found himself unable to carry out his own recommendations
without personal inconvenience, being probably afraid to
offend his colleagues, and nothing has been since done to remove the
scandal.</p></div>

in Roscommon who could neither read nor write, and I am sure I fell
1,000 short of what they actually used. I should think the average in
Munster, especially in Kerry, would be between 5,000 and 6,000. It is well

that to 500.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_46_913" id="Footnote_46_913"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_913"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> A friend of mine travelling in the County Clare sent me three Irish
MSS. the other day, which he found the children tearing to pieces on the
floor. One of these, about one hundred years old, contained a saga called
the "Love of Dubhlacha for Mongan," which M. d'Arbois de Jubainville
had searched the libraries of Europe for in vain. It is true that
another copy of it has since been discovered, and printed and annotated
with all the learning and critical acumen of two such world-renowned
scholars as Professor Kuno Meyer and Mr. Alfred Nutt, both of whom
considered it of the highest value as elucidating the psychology of the
ancient Irish. The copy thus recovered and sent to me is twice as long
as that printed by Kuno Meyer, and had the copy from which he printed
been lost it would be unique. These things are happening every day. A
man living at the very doors of the Chief Commissioner of National
Education writes to me thus: "I could read many of irish Fenian tales
and poems, that was in my father's manuscripts, he had a large collection
of them. I was often sorry for letting them go to loss, but I could not
copy the 1/20th of them.... The writing got defaced, the books got damp
and torn while I was away, I burned lots of them twice that I came to this
country.... I was learning to write the old irish at that time; I could
read a fair share of it and write a little." That man should have been
taught to read and write his native language, and not practically encouraged
to burn the old books, every one of which probably contained some
piece or other not to be found elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Even where the people had no manuscripts in common use amongst
them, their minds were well-stored with poems and lays. A friend wrote
to me from America the other day to interview a man who lived in the
County Galway, who he thought had manuscripts. Not finding it convenient
to do this, I wrote to him, and this is his reply: "Dear sir, about
twenty years since I was able to tell about two Dozen of Ossian's Irish
poems and some of Raftery's, and more Rymes composed by others, but
since that time no one asked me since to tell one Irish story at a wake or
by the fireside sine the old people died. Therefore when I had no
practice I forgot all the storys that ever I had. I am old. Your most
Humble Servant, Michael B."
</p>
<p>
Another writes: "I have no written manuscript. I had three poems
about the dareg more [Dearg Mor] the first when he came to Ireland in
search of his wife that shewed (?) him, when Gaul [Goll] faught him and
tied him he come to Ireland, a few years after, when he got older and
stronger, and faught Gaul for 9 days in succession the ninth day Gaul
killed him then in 18 years after his son called Cun [Conn] came to Ireland
to have revenge and faught Gaul, and after eleven days fighting he was
killed by Gaul. I had a poem called Lee na mna mora [Laoi na mná
móire] or the poem of the big woman who faught Gaul for five days, but
Osker [Oscar] kills her. I had the baptism of Ossian by St. Patrick the
best of all and many others of Ossians' to numerous to mention now, I
also had some poemes of Cucullan the death and the lady in English and
in Irish I had the beettle in English and Irish and when fin [Finn] went to
denmark in English and Irish and many other rymes of modern times.
I seen some address in the Irish times last year where to write to some
place in Dublin where Ossians poems Could be got but I forget the
Number. The people that is living Now a days could not understand the
old Irish which made me drop it altogether their parents is striving to
learn their children English what themselves never learned so the boys
and girls has neither good english or good Irish. Hoping your friends
and well wishers are well, fare well old stock. M...."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_47_914" id="Footnote_47_914"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_914"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> This is the direct result of the system pursued by the National Board,
which refuses to teach the children anything about Patrick and Brigid, but
which is never tired of putting second-hand English models before them.
Archbishop Whately, that able and unconventional Englishman, who had
so much to do with moulding the system, despite his undoubted sense
of humour, saw nothing humorous in making the children learn to
repeat such verses as&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I thank the goodness and the grace</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which on my birth have smiled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made me in these Christian days</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A happy English child!"</span><br />
</p>
<p>
and the tone of the Board may be gathered from this passage, I believe,
which occurred in one of their elementary books: "On the east of Ireland
is England, where the Queen lives. Many people who live in Ireland were
born in England, <i>and we speak the same language, and are called one nation</i>."
The result of this teaching is apparent to every one who lives in Ireland,
and does not shut his eyes. "God forbid I should handicap my daughter
in life by calling her Brigid," said a woman to me once. "It was with
the greatest difficulty I could make any of the Irish christen their children
Patrick," said Father O'Reilly of Louisburgh to me, talking of his Australian
mission. For the wholesale translation of names, such as O'Gara into
Love, O'Lavin into Hand, Mac Rury into Rogers, and so on, which is
still going on with unabated vigour, see an article by me in "Three Irish
Essays," published by Fisher Unwin.</p></div>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
